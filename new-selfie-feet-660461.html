Case in point: The trend has become so popular that “selfie” was named Oxford Dictionaries’ Word of the Year for 2013.</p><p>But this week — as famous faces flock to warm locales to celebrate the holidays — the “footsie” has stolen some of the selfie’s thunder as the social media pose to beat. It isn’t a new thing. Feet are always the perfect distance away for a portrait, and fashionistas can’t resist framing theirs against a beautiful backdrop — the more envy-inducing the better. With feet in the foreground (and no face in sight), nature is recorded at its most beautiful. Tropical beaches, lakes, valleys and mountains are among the locales.</p><p>It is the exclusive domain of women — there are no hairy male toes in the lot — the exception being the pampered peds of <strong>Jay-Z</strong> as captured by his wife, <strong>Beyonce</strong>. The rich depict their lucky “dogs” living the good life, spending time beside infinity-edge pools and aboard speed boats and yachts in the Caribbean and Mediterranean. Glee star <strong>Lea Michele</strong> photographed hers while at an idyllic oceanside resort in Mexico.</p><p>“Feet selfies are usually taken while sunbathing, around the pool or at the beach, up against the railing of a boat or terrace, so one’s naked feet become part of the view,” says <strong>Sharon Graubard</strong>, senior vp&nbsp;creative services at trend-forecasting portal Stylesight. “By shooting your feet, you locate yourself in the setting, personalizing it.”</p><p><strong><a href=#>PHOTOS: Top 10 Stylists to Follow on Instagram</a></strong></p><p>One practitioner of the art is <strong>Gina Tolleson</strong>, executive editor at Santa Barbara Magazine and Miss World 1991. According to her, “Selfies say, ‘I am here. I am present in this beautiful location or moment. How lucky I am to touch my feet on this hallowed ground.’ ”</p><p>No words are required. “Resting one’s feet in a beautiful setting reveals how lucky we may feel in the moment, or simply that we are taking a load off for a little while to enjoy life less burdened,” says <strong>Joe Navarro</strong>, a body language expert and adjunct faculty at St. Leo University in Florida. “It signals status, authority, power, happiness or contentment.”</p><p>With one shot, we tell the world, “I am not working on a beautiful day, just relaxing.” An effect Graubard describes as, ” ‘I am here and you are not.’ It’s definitely a vanity shot.”</p><p><strong><a href=#>STORY: Gwyneth Paltrow Joins Instagram</a></strong></p><p>Apparently, our tootsies show emotion. “When we are happy, we wiggle our toes and walk with a bounce. Feet together is comforting, feet apart is more territorial,” says Navarro, who finds it interesting that the feet are always in focus.</p><p>By nature, the feet-selfies (footsies?) should never look like you are trying too hard. Images are often cock-eyed as cocktails are just out of frame and sometimes even in the shot. “Crooked horizons add to the spontaneous hand-held documentary quality,” says Graubard. That said, she advises: “The best selfies are artistic — it’s an image, after all — so composition, focus and color still count!”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8uinZ6rpK65pnvSrbClnV%2Bjsrh50p6jn6GVYrOmsdNmbW9oZGt%2BcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1551644-bachelors-gabi-elnicki-age-height-birthday-family-job.html><span>←</span><span>The Bachelors Gabi Elnicki: age, height, birthday, family, job</span></a>
