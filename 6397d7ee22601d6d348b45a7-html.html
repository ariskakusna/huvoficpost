"I don't want them out there in this s-t. It was horrible. We sucked."</p><p>Brady's candor to the media could be part of his future, as he has signed a contract to be the lead color commentator for Fox Sports when he decides to retire, although according to reports, that won't happen after this season as <strong>TB12</strong> is set to return in 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jqedpWeklrqxrYybmLJlkqqwpK3Nnpyrq19nfXN%2BjmppaGljZIN0hZadbp6dYmeDcX3Db5tsbGiXgXatlmefraWc</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-heart-wrenching-death-of-louie-anderson.html><span>←</span><span>The Heart-Wrenching Death Of Louie Anderson</span></a>
