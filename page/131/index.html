Nearly eight-and-a-half years after Mohammad Gulab and his fellow villagers harbored and saved the life of a gravely wounded U.S. Navy SEAL, they say they are still proud of their courageous action and would do it again in spite of the disappointments and troubles that have followed. In the face of point-blank Taliban threats to overrun the small village of Sabray in remote Kunar Province, along the porous and mountainous frontier with Pakistan, the villagers bravely protected, gave first aid to, fed, and clothed Marcus Luttrell, the wounded Special Warfare Operator, the only survivor of a four-man SEAL patrol.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Beekeeper | Rotten Tomatoes</h2><time>Aug 10, 2024</time>

The Kardashian crew might be known popularizing the term "Bible!"—a way to express something you really mean, originating from people swearing on the Bible in court—on their show Keeping Up with the Kardashians, but the family's relationship with religious text goes far beyond slang. “We don’t share it much, but we’re really religious," Kardashian said of her famous family in an interview with Vogue. "We start our day with a group chat with a Bible verse from my mom, and everyone chimes in on the meaning of it.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Vanessa Hudgens Stepped Out Wearing Two Controversial Trends in One Look</h2><time>Aug 10, 2024</time>
<a href=../../vanessa-hudgens-controversial-throwback-trends-instagram-post-7565706.html></a>
Vanessa Hudgens can nonchalantly make a monochrome sweatsuit and clogs ensemble look like the picture of sophistication, so it's no surprise that she would make a go-to pattern of the early aughts and the controversial hairstyle from our childhood look good. On Tuesday, Vanessa shared a series of snaps detailing her OOTD filled with taboo trends at the Glossy Beauty Pop Panel in Los Angeles. In the Instagram post, the actress debuted a grown-up version of twisted pigtails, which she teamed with a structured white-and-silver chevron printed blazer and matching miniskirt set from MISSONI’s fall/winter 2023 collection.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Victoria Beckham's 15 engagement rings now cost a staggering 34m - full price ranking</h2><time>Aug 10, 2024</time>
<a href=../../victoria-beckham-15-engagement-rings-now-cost-34-million-price-ranking.html></a>
The Spice Girls star's most expensive rock is estimated to cost £6 million Over 24 years of marriage, David Beckham has gifted his wife Victoria Beckham with some beautiful (and sometimes eye-wateringly expensive) jewellery.
This includes 15 engagement rings, starting with the marquise-cut diamond the former England football captain proposed with in 1998. After details of their engagement and wedding were covered in their new four-part Netflix documentary, we can't help but wonder exactly how much money the couple shelled out for the former Spice Girls star's gorgeous ring collection.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>What is the difference between Dasuquin advanced and Dasuquin?</h2><time>Aug 10, 2024</time>

Any retrospective of John Mayer's dating history has to start with Jennifer Love Hewitt, often thought to be the woman behind Mayer's biggest hit, "Your Body is a Wonderland." But the song came out a year before the pair started dating, so anyone paying attention would know that's not the case. Afterward, Mayer dated songster Vanessa Carlton for about a year, per Wonderwall, and she later called him a "bad breaker-upper.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Why can moody see Harry's cloak?</h2><time>Aug 10, 2024</time>
<a href=../../why-can-moody-see-harrys-cloak.html></a>
The invisibility cloak was supposedly perfect, impervious to all magically aided sight. I'm sure, in retrospect, J K Rowling would agree that Moody's eye should never have been able to see Harry through the cloak. Yes, possibly sense him in the way Dumbledore can sense the trace that magic leaves. How does Moody see through Harrys cloak? The Invisibility Cloak of the Deathly Hallows is supposed to be unlike other cloaks, which can be detected through alternative means.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../page/130/>← Prev Page</a>
