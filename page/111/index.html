<a href=../../is-vicks-harmful-to-cats-html.html></a>
Answer
Toxicity to animals
For example, Carmex, Tiger Balm, Vicks VapoRub, Campho-Phenique, and other commonly used trade names that include camphor are listed below. Because camphor is easily absorbed through the skin, it should never be applied to dogs or cats due to the risk of poisoning they may experience.
As a result, one may wonder whether Vicks is safe for cats to inhale in this situation? Menthol is not harmful when breathed, but it may be dangerous if consumed in large quantities, so keep the Biofreeze bottle away from Shanie and any other children.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Italian towns claim Ron DeSantis as one of their own as Republican race heats up | Ron DeSantis</h2><time>Aug 13, 2024</time>
