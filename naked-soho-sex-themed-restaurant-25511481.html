According to their website, they had to cover their windows up after locals knocked on their doors.</p><p>They said: "We wanted to create a space where people can be as free as possible, where anything goes. If you want to stand next to a wall of dicks and vulvas of all shapes and sizes, who's to stop you?</p><p><b>READ MORE: </b><a data-content-type=opinion data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>‘I tried London’s best bao buns and they were delicious but ridiculously expensive’</a></p><p>"Gay, straight, queer, trans, S&M fetishes, feet kinks - anything you want to be you can be at Naked Soho. Celebrate your birthday with us and enjoy a cake with a massive, erect penis sitting on top.</p><p>"Wild it out at your hen party or stag do with a mouth full of dick waffles and titty cupcakes. Naked Soho will be your new favourite hot spot for good food, good vibes, and good times, we promise!"</p><p>Their menu is every bit as sex-positive as their manifesto and is divided into five categories: A Bit of Foreplay, NSWF Tapas, Tossing Salads!, The Climax, and Happy Endings. A Bit of Foreplay consists of charcuterie or veggies plated on a penis-shaped board.</p><p>The tapas includes dishes like smoked salmon with smashed avocado and feta, and gorgonzola with walnuts and honey. There's also a Parma ham and mozzarella dish and a cherry tomato salad.</p><p>The salads include classics like a chicken salad and a salmon and salame version, as well as the raunchier 'co**prese salad'. The latter is a caprese with a parmesan crisp, but with a funny name.</p><p>For mains, or 'the climax', you can choose between several classic Italian dishes. There's carbonara, butternut squash fiorelli, truffle mushroom risotto, bolognese, and pasta all'arrabbiata.</p><p>Happy Endings - aka dessert - includes penis-shaped waffles subtly titled 'Eat a Dick!', baba al rum called 'drunk c**ks', the 'tall, dark and handsome' chocolate truffle brownie torte, and a tiramisu, aka a 'speedy finish'. There's a drinks menu too, with loads more sexual puns.</p><p>Their signature cocktail is a 'Kinky F***ery', which in made with gin, green apple syrup, elderflower, and green chartreuse. 'Mr Dick' is the restaurant's twist on an espresso martini, and the menu also includes the 'Goddess of Sex', the 'No Pain No Gain', 'Nipple Clamps', and a 'Screaming Orgasm'.</p><p>Naked Soho does wine and beer too, and they've got a signature shot called The Sloppy B*** J**. The restaurant has great reviews too, with 4.4 out of five stars on Google Reviews.</p><p>One person wrote: "Amazing restaurant, incredible concept with a huge emphasis on art, and extremely friendly service. Love love love!" Another said: "Have you ever wanted a place that has positive vibes, an aesthetic, good beverages, good music AND a staff that matches the place and brings it to another level? This is the spot for you."</p><p><b>Want more from MyLondon?
