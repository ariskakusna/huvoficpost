Twenty-one years ago, a single mum living on welfare penned a story on a train which would go on to become one of the best-selling books of all time.
But publishers were doubtful about the idea of J.K. Rowling's wizardry world.
After receiving &#34;loads&#34; of rejections, Bloomsbury — a publishing house in London — finally gave Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone the green light in 1997, paying the author a £2500 (NZ$4,818) advance, and printing just 500 copies."><meta name=author content="Patria Henriques"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

He often spoke on behalf of muggles (humans). She said this was the reason the Potter family were left out of the Sacred Twenty Eight — the list of 28 British families of pure magic blood.</p><p>"The anonymous compiler of that supposedly definitive list of pure-bloods suspected that they had sprung from what he considered to be tainted blood," Rowling wrote.</p><p>Rowling also offered shocking new insight into the Potter descendants, revealing the family is actually descended from a 12th-century eccentric wizard named Linfred of Stinchcombe, who was originally given the nickname "The Potterer".</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>"In the Muggle world 'Potter' is an occupational surname, meaning a man who creates pottery," she told fans.</p><p>"The wizarding family of Potters descends from the twelfth-century wizard Linfred of Stinchcombe, a locally well-beloved and eccentric man, whose nickname, 'the Potterer', became corrupted in time to 'Potter'."</p><p><strong>Rowling turned down a role in the movies</strong></p><p>Most muggles would have jumped at the chance to appear in one of the Harry Potter movies — just not Rowling.</p><p>The author was offered the role of Harry's mum but wasn't interested.</p><p>She later said: "The filmmakers did ask me to play Lily Potter in the first film, but I really am not cut out to be an actress, even one who just has to stand there and wave.
