The company has also seen significant growth in other ways as well, including the fact that they will hold the next All In event at the Wembley Stadium this year. It seems the pre-sale sign ups for the upcoming event are showing a lot of promise.</p><p><a href=#>Tony Khan’s big announcement&nbsp;</a>came around this week on AEW Dynamite, which ended up changing the course of AEW in a big way. AEW will take over Wembley Stadium on August 27th for AEW All In London, and fans are excited to see that Sunday event taking place.</p><p>This is a certainly a major move by the company as the London stadium holds up to 90,000 fans. The last time that a wrestling show was held at the venue was in 1992 for WWE SummerSlam, which had 80,000 in attendance.</p><p>As fans know by now, AEW is a pretty big deal in the United Kingdom as they have already done shows there in the past. Even then, it will take a lot more effort to help fill out the Wembley Stadium, which is a daunting task for the company.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wrestling Observer Newsletter</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dave Meltzer</a>&nbsp;reported that the pre-sale registration for the show had generated 25,000. This is obviously a very good sign for the promotion and they will be trying to carry forward with the momentum from here on out.</p><p>Tickets go on sale to the public on 5/5, but they are doing a pre-register for early access with a code, and there will be a pre-sale on 5/2. That will largely give a strong clue as to how successful the show will end up being. There were reports of 25,000 sign-ups the first day.</p><p>The belief is this will be a pay-per-view event, for obvious reasons. It will take place a week before the traditionally the All Out pay-per-view event on Labor Day Weekend. We’ll have to wait and see how the event will turn out.</p><p>What’s your take on these pre-sale numbers? Are you excited for All In?
