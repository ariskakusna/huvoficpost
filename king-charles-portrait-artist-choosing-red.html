"I just then worked on making sure nothing else interfered with the balance. It was a nice mix of the traditional and the contemporary."</p><p>The artist went on to add that he made a concerted effort to ensure that “nothing else interfered with the balance” of the piece, adding that "it was a nice mix of the traditional and the contemporary.”</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
