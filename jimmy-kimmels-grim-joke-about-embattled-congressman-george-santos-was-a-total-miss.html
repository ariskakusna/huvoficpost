According to <a href=#>CNN</a>, the Congressman was charged with "theft by deception" for writing a string of bad checks to dog breeders, which included an Amish farmer. The whopping total of checks that bounced came out to more than $15,000. The farmer recalled the event, telling the outlet, "He says, 'We are going to take that puppy and that puppy.' And his assistant grabs the two puppies, takes them out the door, and he pulls out a check. I was like, 'Oh no, is this guy going to pay me with a check?' I was very suspicious."&nbsp;Despite the evidence presented, however, charges against Santos were eventually expunged in 2021, as reported by <a href=#>Politico</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>In Jimmy Kimmel's mind, these unfortunate circumstances made for a perfect comedic set-up. During his monologue on a February 15 episode of <a href=#>"Jimmy Kimmel Live,"</a> Kimmel joked, "Stealing puppies from the Amish? This could be the crime of the century. The 18th century." The audience burst into laughter, but not for long. After a series of Santos quips, Kimmel added, "And the big question is, what did he do with the puppies? I mean, is this what his sweater vests are made out of?" The crowd collectively whimpered, clearly upset by the thought of dead puppies donning Santos' torso. Kimmel caught on fast, saying, "Don't worry. It's just a joke, guys." Smooth save, Kimmel ...&nbsp; really&nbsp;smooth.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampgZ4B3hI6joKalqWK4qrnMnqOsZZentq55yaiinmWRl7y2wIyepJuZpKm5prCMnKann6KawLS5wKdkoJ2fp7SmedKapa2no2LEor%2BMmmStp6SWuW65yKyqaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-many-volts-is-a-house-power-line.html><span>←</span><span>How many volts is a house power line?</span></a>
