I was putting all my energy into my business; I didn’t have anything left for anything else. I was demotivated, uninspired and uninterested and I became all about work.</p><p id=ethrlxqSsf- data-wc=30>I had lost my identity. And it wasn’t just me. My husband was fed up, feeling neglected and having to deal with all the negative energy I was constantly expressing.</p><p id=eiKkVEauBTi data-wc=40>My nan’s passing in 2021 stopped me in my tracks.

I was ill and both my husband and I needed a break from the madness.</p><p id=e7E1Cwt1L1- data-wc=49>So, we decided to quit our jobs and pack up our lives in the UK and travel the world. It wasn’t an easy decision to make. It took several therapy sessions to help me through the process. It was the scariest, but the best decision I have ever made.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8f2eaa11c899-costa-rica.jpg><p id=eEpKTNlgLu- data-wc=43>We left in September 2021 and had been travelling for almost a year before we decided to go to South America. We started in Croatia, then travelled to Turkey, Mexico, Sri Lanka, Slovenia, Bosnia, Serbia, Montenegro, Albania, Greece, more of Turkey and Bulgaria.</p><p id=e36WqESOta0N data-wc=31>South America had always called to me and is a place that had always inspired me, so when we were planning the next stage of our trip, South America made sense.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8a91960f144d-ecuador.jpg><p id=eqh_COUtANQy data-wc=36>We started in Costa Rica, Central America, for one month and then for five months we travelled and explored Columbia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Chile and Bolivia ending our journey with five days in the Amazon Rainforest.</p><p id=eJveH8gXHcNp data-wc=14><strong>&nbsp;READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>I ditched my phone for a whole week – here's what I learned</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2><strong>Our time in the Amazon Rainforest</strong></h2><p id=eQlBnqBiDKKW data-wc=48>The journey into the Amazon was transformative. We stayed in eco-lodges, switching off for five days without phone signal or wi-fi. I was a little apprehensive about immersing myself in nature so fully and completely switching off, but I was also excited to see what I would discover.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a489be114506-amazon-7.jpg><h2><strong>Struggles in the rainforest</strong></h2><p id=e4n-iUXsfY6M data-wc=19>The Amazon certainly tested my tenacity, with hours-long hikes through the jungle, but the main concern was the rain.</p><p id=euPrG_JyU9jD data-wc=39>It was the tailend of the rainy season, so heavy rains were a worry but we only had one afternoon with a total downpour. Though a relief, our activities were pushed back, stopping us from reaching the intended campsite.</p><p id=eaugFOw2L8Az data-wc=12><strong>&nbsp;READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Affected by anxiety and stress? You could have nature deficit disorder</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eL_6n5G3nLb0 data-wc=53>This led to a five-hour hike to an overnight makeshift camp in the mud, which was scary. We had to keep the fire burning to keep the jaguars away and I almost stepped on a scorpion. But all in the name of adventure and the magical moments more than made up for it.</p><p id=eI65NLVToT-C data-wc=44>The rain was a profound moment for me, though. One time it was raining heavily and I simply stood outside in it, closed my eyes and cried. For the first time in a long time, I felt that I had truly let myself go.</p><h2><strong>What I learned about myself in the rainforest</strong></h2><p id=e0qSuIDs_EH7 data-wc=20>The entire South American journey was a catalyst for long-lasting change. It was fitting that it ended in the Amazon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7c0419dd13c5-peru.jpg><p id=eGozb0Gnhe0T data-wc=19>Over time, I learned to appreciate life and the experiences it provides and how to be open to them.</p><p id=eHG-Kx8t9kVx data-wc=39>Healing from burnout was the most profound experience - I felt myself getting stronger, gaining more energy and my confidence grew. I was also managing my anxiety and I had rediscovered my creativity and love for writing and poetry.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="I went on my first solo holiday at 69 – here's what happened" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/780b08da50a6-joanne-macleod-holiday.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="I went on my first solo holiday at 69 – here's what happened" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>I went on my first solo holiday at 69 – here's what happened</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=eEmCnp4h42dE data-wc=25>The isolation and challenging conditions of the rainforest taught me that I have inner strength and resilience and it also taught me to let go.</p><p id=eFnBZXkf_rmp data-wc=32>If something isn’t working, it isn’t supposed to and everything is temporary, so make the most of what you have, when you have it and don’t stress over what you can’t control.</p><p id=eeqb1EwAom data-wc=13><strong>READ:</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;I overhauled my entire life on a whim – here's what happened</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=emC50kIQaaCx data-wc=38>Since this trip, I have learned to set healthy boundaries, I’m making better choices for myself, my relationship is thriving and so is my new PR and marketing agency <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>BE YELLOW</a>, which envelopes all of my new values.</p><p id=erJRh2B4NwgX data-wc=58>I am still travelling, but a lot slower and I try to choose places where I can connect to nature in one way or another.
