Franchitti broke two&nbsp;vertebrae and his right ankle, in addition to suffering a concussion, <a href=#>USA Today</a> reported. Debris from the accident also injured at least 13 spectators according to <a href=#>CNN</a>. In light of Franchitti's injuries, the "Divergent" actor dropped everything and raced to his side.&nbsp;</p><p>"Thank you for the prayers for @dariofranchitti I have only clothes on my back & the dogs but that's all that we need & we are on our way," Judd&nbsp;<a href=#>tweeted</a> on October 6, 2013. Franchitti was taken to&nbsp;Memorial Hermann Texas Medical Center, where he underwent surgery on his ankle the same day of the accident. Judd was right there. "Amazed by the incredible outpouring of care & prayers," she <a href=#>tweeted</a> the following day. "Thanks, everyone. Keeping our heads down here & doing what's in front of us to do."</p><p>The severity of his injuries&nbsp;put an end to Franchitti's career. The experience reportedly brought them closer together, making them question their decision to divorce. "They are going to give it another try after he recovers," a source told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>. "His accident made her realize how much she loves him." But Judd and Franchitti didn't get back together. Their divorce was finalized that same year, but the exes remained close... even if their separation was hard on them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtlZ4JzfY6smpqqqWKupK%2FInZynrF2nsqy1zZ2jnpxdlsCpuMSyZKOtlJl6psSMoaysmpGjsXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./thanksgiving-2022-best-shows-to-watch.html><span>←</span><span>Thanksgiving 2022: 8 of the best TV episodes you need to watch this holiday season</span></a>
