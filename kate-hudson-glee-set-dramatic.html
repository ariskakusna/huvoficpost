"As dramatic as it was—and it's so interesting to hear you say that Kate—there's just so many moving parts of our show, and so many cast members, and so many personalities."</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

"The other thing is you had extraordinary talent on that show."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2n7TCs48JwSbtL8qQqgEQY-1920-80.jpg><p>"There's a reason why very talented people can sometimes be challenging to work with: They can be uncompromising. They really believe in themselves," Hudson continued. "They know what they have to offer, and so you know, you get all of that in one room, and there's going to be some fun drama."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJuVobKjvsitsGijkamybrTUnaqopl2cuaaxjKycrWWUp66urdOimmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kally-berard-net-worth-159076.html><span>←</span><span>Kally Berard Net Worth</span></a>
