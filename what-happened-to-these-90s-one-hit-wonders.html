For starters, it was accompanied by a <a href=#>music video</a> that introduced the world to the&nbsp;"Bee Girl," a sweet kid who became a slight pop culture obsession. And then there was its global commercial success, with the song reaching the No. 1 spot on several rock charts (via <a href=#>Songfacts</a>). The group was already touring, but the success of "No Rain" and their debut album led to more road time (via <a href=#>Louder Sound</a>) and the making of their sophomore album, 1995's "Soup."</p><p dir=ltr>Touring, while great for Blind Melon's promotion, had its downsides. According to <a href=#>Ultimate Classic Rock</a>, singer Shannon Hoon struggled with drug addiction during the band's intense touring schedule and sudden catapult into the mainstream. He tried to get sober several times, but unfortunately, those stints didn't stick. And despite Hoon's addiction issues, Blind Melon kept touring to promote "Soup." Sadly, during that tour in October 1995,&nbsp;28-year-old Hoon died on the band's tour bus after overdosing on cocaine, forever changing the group (via Louder Sound).&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>According to the <a href=#>band's website</a>, surviving members of Blind Melon spent years trying to find a new lead singer, to no avail. The band broke up in 1999, but got back together in 2006 with a new singer. They released an album in 2008 (via <a href=#>Guitar World</a>) and put out several songs in 2021.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>If you or anyone you know needs help with addiction issues, help is available.
