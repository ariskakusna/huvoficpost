He got sentenced to three to five years in prison on April 21, 2023. We are now in August 23, 2023, and there’s no official word about his release. So, it’s safe to say that he’s still behind bars, serving his sentence for what he did.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>The Length of Dthang Gz’s Jail Time</strong></h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Dthang Gz, who is a popular rapper from the Bronx drill music scene, found himself facing a prison term between three to five years on April 21, 2023.

These charges were related to a bunch of shootings carried out by the RPT gang in the Bronx, which led to a massive 65-count indictment against him. These charges included things like planning to commit murder, trying to murder someone, attempting assault, and having weapons without permission. It’s unclear when he’ll be released, but considering the date is August 23, 2023, he’s likely still in jail.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>Dthang Gz’s Real Name</strong></h3><p>Dthang Gz, or Daniel Collins as he’s known to the world outside of music, is a major figure in the Bronx drill music scene. He’s a rapper with a lot of energy, and his music has attracted more than 10 million views on YouTube.

He got into a shooting incident that was connected to a turf conflict, which eventually got him arrested. His charges weren’t just about violence in real life; they also included the violence he rapped about in his drill music. This shows that he’s more than just a musician; he’s a complex character with legal issues.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><h3><strong>Dthang Gz’s Sentence</strong></h3><p>Dthang Gz, or Daniel Collins, a big name in the Bronx drill music scene, received a prison sentence of three to five years on April 21, 2023. This was all because of his involvement in a series of shootings that were connected to the RPT gang, a part of the Bloods street gang. All of this led to a massive 65-count indictment against him. The charges included planning to commit murder, trying to murder someone, trying to assault someone, and having weapons illegally. The RICO law (Racketeer Influenced & Corrupt Organizations) was also used in this case because there was a criminal organization involved in these events. The exact date of his release isn’t known, but his sentencing happened after he got arrested and admitted his guilt to multiple charges. This resulted in a lower number of charges against him. His sentencing and the time he’s spending in jail show that his career had both high-energy music performances and ties to violent incidents with legal consequences.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>How Old is Dthang Gz?</strong></h3><p>Dthang Gz, whose real name is Daniel Collins, was only 20 years old when he got sentenced on April 21, 2023.
