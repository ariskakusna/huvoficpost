Who needs an Ugly Christmas Sweater when you can rock the Christmas spirit on your face all year long? Move aside, red lipstick, come to me, Christmas eyebrows.</p><p>The trend started last year, with beauty gurus brushing and waxing their eyebrows to look like branches, setting them with wax, and attaching baubles, glitter, and even stars to resemble the most festive of holidays. Instagram user @taytay_xx deserves a lot of the credit for launching the trend in December 2017, and it really took off with this holiday season. It's great because if you are going to endeavor into this look, that's the very definition of&nbsp;extra, you can choose to go as minimal or as over-the-top as you like, just like your mom's Christmas tree.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it just me, or is Christmas extra Christmas-y this year?</p><p>Ignore your Boy Brow‚Äîwe're all about glittery, festive brows at the tail-end of 2018. It's the exact opposite from "everyday wearable," but it's totally Instagram-friendly.
