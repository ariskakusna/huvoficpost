However, if you're tempted by Chrissy Teigen's <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.homesandgardens.com/interior-design/paint-ideas>paint ideas</a> – you may be happy to know that this hue has approval from those in the design industry – so you can paint with more confidence.&nbsp;</p><p>While gold may seem like a somewhat unconventional <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.homesandgardens.com/interior-design/room-color-ideas>color idea</a> – the paint experts at <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url=https://www.benjaminmoorepaint.co.uk/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Benjamin Moore </a>suggest that this hue has a firm place amid spring and summer trends this 2023 – and of course, with the model's approval, we're inclined to agree.&nbsp;</p><p>'From soft, pale sunshine to zingy lime-tinted yellow, 'golden tones' is all about bringing the warmth of summer into your home [at all times of the year],' the experts say. They say that the color is particularly beautiful when paired when teamed with white or black – or other golds – for a beautiful luxe aesthetic that will, of course, come with celebrity approval.&nbsp;</p><p>'This look can be anything from anything from quiet and gentle to striking and memorable,' they say.
