Furthermore, Metro Boomin and Future had numerous <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">songs appear in the Billboard Top 10</a>. This subsequently led to a subtle shot from DJ Akademiks. On his Instagram page, Akademiks made the claim that the artists used Drake's name for clout, and that he deserves an assist for the streaming numbers. "Congrats to Metro Future Kendrick and the reason for the song Drake. On a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">#1</a>&nbsp;song. Here’s the billboard top 10 this week," Akademiks wrote.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-drake-with-a-slick-like>Drake With A Slick Like</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In a showing of solidarity for the take, Drake ended up liking Ak's post. Clearly, he enjoyed the caption and felt there was some sort of truth in it. Of course, the fact that he was dissed on the song certainly helped its position on the charts. However, it is a damn good song and even if Kendrick had delivered a normal verse, it probably would have been a success. After all, Metro and Future know how to crank out the hits. Either way, a like might not seem like a lot, but it shows where Drizzy stands in all of this.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know what you think of the feud between Drake, Kendrick Lamar, Metro Boomin, and Future, in the comments section down below.
