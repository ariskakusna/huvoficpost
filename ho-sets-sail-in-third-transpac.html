Start days are separated based on division, which depends on the size and speed of the boat.</p><p><span class=quotations>“I remember watching the boat from shore as a kid in the 80’s. … It’s a dream come true, it’s a really special boat and has a really special place in sailing,”</span> said Ho, 45, via phone from California earlier this week. <span class=quotations>“It’s still a really competitive boat and it’s just fun to be a part of and I think we have a realistic shot of being competitive.”</span></p><p>Ho has been sailing since childhood and after moving to Hawaii from California at the age of 13, his interest in the sport grew. He attended the University of Hawaii and joined the sailing team, which is among the top in the country.</p><p><span class=quotations>“The teammate work, preparation and perseverance,”</span> he said of his favorite aspects of competitive sailing. <span class=quotations>“Also, just feeling connected to nature and the ocean.”</span></p><img width=560 height=840 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.mauinews.com/images/2019/07/13052706/17-fc-merlin-2017-560x840.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption>The Merlin sails in the 2017 Transpac. -- SHARON GREEN photo</p><p>Now, Ho — a Maui County firefighter — runs his own business called GungHo Sailing out of Lahaina Harbor and is a U.S. Sailing Level I Instructor. Additionally, Ho is a junior sailing coach with the Lahaina Yacht Club.</p><p>Ho said that the Merlin Yacht Racing team’s goal is to finish the Transpac in under eight days, weather permitting.</p><p><span class=quotations>“It depends on how long it takes for us to get off the coast of California,”</span> he said. <span class=quotations>“The boat is definitely faster now than it was, so as long as we can sail good or better, then we should hopefully do better.”</span></p><p>The Merlin is among the 90 yachts that will race 2,225 nautical miles across the Pacific Ocean, starting from Point Fermin in Los Angeles and ending off Diamond Head in Honolulu.</p><p>According to the Transpac website, sailors are anticipated to reach Honolulu as early as Wednesday.</p><p><span class=quotations>“It really takes a lifetime of preparation,”</span> Ho said. <span class=quotations>“But the immediate preparation is to make sure you’re physically fit and you’re in good health, and that you are well acquainted with your crew and your boat.”</span></p><p>This will be Ho’s third Transpac race and his second aboard Merlin, a sailboat designed in the 1970s by Bill Lee.</p><p>Since its debut, Merlin has had multiple owners, but a couple years ago, Lee bought the yacht back for the 2017 Transpac race. Ho helped the crew to finish third that year in its division and eighth overall.</p><p>A small group from the same crew competed with Ho last summer in the 635-mile Bermuda Race.</p><p>Transpac race updates, progress and photos of the crew can be found on the Transpac website and @gunghosailing on Instagram.</p><p><span class=quotations>“A week ago, we spent seven days down here practicing, working on the boat and preparing,”</span> Ho said. <span class=quotations>“Everyday is just a constant progression towards being more prepared and faster.”</span></p><p>And while making the necessary preparations in California, Ho’s thoughts are with his his fellow Maui firefighters as they battle the brush fires that have, as of Friday evening, scorched more than 9,000 acres since Thursday morning.</p><p><span class=quotations>“I’m just thinking of everybody and telling them to stay safe and stay hydrated,”</span> he said Friday. <span class=quotations>“I have confidence in them, they’re all really good at it. They’ll get it handled.”</span></p><p>* Dakota Grossman is at dgrossman@mauinews.com</p><p>Today's breaking news and more in your inbox</p><a href=#></a> <a href=#></a><p>Today • HHSAA swimming and diving 8:30 a.m.—State championships, dive finals, at Kihei Aquatic Center. 1 ...</p><a href=#></a><p>BOWLING ALOHA FRIDAY LEAGUE Feb. 2 Results At Wailuku Lanes Standings—Anela’s 61, Jonathan’s 59.5, ...</p><a href=#></a><p>Lola Donez scored 19 points in her final game with the Lahainaluna High School girls basketball team as the Lunas ...</p><a href=#></a><p>Top-seeded Iolani School got a golden goal off the post in the 89th minute on Friday night for a 1-0 overtime win ...</p><a href=#></a> <a href=#></a><p>Today • HHSAA swimming and diving 10 a.m.—State championships, dive prelims, at Kihei Aquatic ...</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3UoqWer6NjsLC5jqynqKqkqHytu8Kao2aroKS%2Ftb%2BOa2dqcV9lhHC0zmaqnqyjYsCitctmoKdlpJ22s7CMramapqOlrqR7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hit-me-up-by-omar-apollo-kenny-beats-dominic-fike.html><span>←</span><span>Hit Me Up by Omar Apollo, Kenny Beats &amp;amp; Dominic Fike</span></a>
