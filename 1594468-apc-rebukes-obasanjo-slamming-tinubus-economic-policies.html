He views himself as the best leader while considering all other leaders to be inferior. This attitude is unbecoming of a statesman, as no one has a monopoly on knowledge or leadership style.Obasanjo has a long history of criticizing those in leadership positions, except himself. This pattern is not new or isolated. President Bola Tinubu is just the latest target of Obasanjo's critiques; Buhari and Jonathan were also subjected to his attacks. Obasanjo's tenure was not without its flaws, as he oversaw the fragmentation of the Nigerian economy.<h2>Obasanjo lists Tinubu’s 2 wrong policies</h2><p class=align-left>In a related development,<strong> Legit.ng</strong> reported that former president Obasanjo has <a href=#>described </a>president Tinubu’s policies on fuel subsidy removal and exchange rates as necessary but “wrongly implemented.”</p><p class=align-left>The former president zeroed in on three decisions of the current administration, which included fuel subsidy removal, exchange rates, and dealing with the military coup in <a href=#>Niger</a> Republic.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkvbC4yK2gnKtfZoJ6gJNvb2aZoJh6s7HBrqKeq12kr6K%2FwKehqGWjoa6uucinnmasmaPCo8HSZpycp56kuqqvjKmmpaGTnrK0ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amber-heard-welcomes-baby-girl-surrogate-johnny-depp-split.html><span>←</span><span>Amber Heard welcomes baby girl via surrogate five years after Johnny Depp split and reveals unique n</span></a>
