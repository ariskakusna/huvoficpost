I lived with the plants and the river so I created this as somewhere I could remember (that).”</p><p>The materials used to make the gardens were sourced from his home country of Laos, in Southeast Asia.</p><p>Other features include a waterfall, bamboo gardens, Asian-style rock sculptures and lanterns and a private beach with tropical trees.</p><p>Mr Southideth introduced various rare bamboo species and hundreds of coloured koi fish to the property, but said he was most proud of his earthmoving work.</p><p>“My favourite part is the cave. It is amazing how ­nature creates caves and how beautiful they are so I tried to recreate that,” he said.</p><p>Listing agent Sam Nguyen of Wiseberry Campbelltown said the property was one of a kind.</p><p>“I’ve never seen anything like it,” Mr Nguyen said.</p><p>“Find me a home in Sydney with a cave and a waterfall on top of it. It’s insane.”</p><p>The gardens have attracted local church groups and temple organisations, who use the grounds for cultural and religious purposes.</p><p>It has also been used to host meditation sessions and Chinese New Year celebrations.</p><p>“The owner doesn’t charge people to use the property. He just lets them come into his back yard and often has them around for a barbecue,” Mr Nguyen said</p><p>The site has intrigued ­prospective buyers and attracted a substantial level of interest, Mr Nguyen added.</p><p>Mr Southideth said he plans to move to Queensland once he sells the property, but will miss the tranquillity of the estate.</p><p>“It’s very peaceful. Every day there is like a holiday,” he&nbsp;said.</p><p>Originally published as <a class=body-link href=#>This tropical gem has a cave and a beach</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7zZqroqeelrlwutKwZJqbpGS7tMOMq5yapF2awLWt055mp52nqHq0wM6rsGhwY5eFp7CPbnBunGOarqaAxW%2BdnmxibH55g5BsmZ5rkQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-young-and-the-restless-spoilers-claire-faces-off-with-jordan.html><span>←</span><span>The Young and the Restless spoilers: Claire faces off with Jordan</span></a>
