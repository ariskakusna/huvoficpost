Nieves and Ehle also spoke of the tactics they used to get through the traumatic scenes that they shared, including tap patterns and safe words. "Yeah, we had it all,"&nbsp;Nieves said. "After every take, we would just hug it out. After those scenes were finished, we would cry together. I was very safe.</p><p>Ehle added, "Sometimes working the dark stuff is the most fun to do. This wasn't fun. This one wasn't fun." Nieves does a brilliant job of bringing the trauma suffered at the hands of countless young Native children to the screen, and will no doubt earn many more future roles with her powerful performance in "1923."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbvOqZyrZpOkunB9kG1qbHBkZMSpu4ypo5qxo2LBprvNp5hmqpGeu7it056pZqeeYn56fpJo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-angelica-castro-dating-now-past-relationships-current-relationship-status-rumours-and-facts-html.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Angelica Castro Dating Now?
