Their mother Kate attended the prestigious&nbsp;Marlborough College between 1996 and 2000 and was spotted visiting the school in 2023.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9c618110537d-gettyimages-1243027415.jpg><p id=eMCsd5jhWXX data-wc=21>The mother-of-three enjoyed her time at Marlborough so it's very likely that Charlotte may follow in her footsteps and study there.</p><p id=ekgkolL4eZ1 data-wc=29>The £46,995-per-year co-educational independent boarding school&nbsp;is&nbsp;based in Wiltshire,&nbsp;and welcomes pupils aged 13 to 18.

In preparation for her role as monarch, she studied constitutional history and law, and was educated in religion by the Archbishop of Canterbury.&nbsp;</p><p id=ebTI02kZqF data-wc=19>The young queen also learnt French and enjoyed art and music.
