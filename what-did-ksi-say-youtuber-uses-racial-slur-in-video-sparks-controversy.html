YouTuber’s Racial Slur Sparks Controversy</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>On Sunday, KSI featured in a YouTube video along with his Sidemen group. The group played a game based on the show Countdown, where each participant had to create the longest word possible from a combination of random vowels and consonants. KSI chose four letters and formed the word ‘p*ki.’&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>While his friends giggled over his choice, the rapper said, “I don’t mean this maliciously, but the word’s p*ki.” The slang is considered offensive and is used as a derogatory remark against people of Pakistan and South Asia in general. The video faced huge backlash and was eventually taken down from YouTube.</span></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Nah <a href=#>@ksi</a> you’re not funny man you cannot say “P*ki” in any context</p><p>These lot will do anything for content🙄<a href=#>pic.twitter.com/qrotwIkobr</a></p><p>— Kini🎋 (@lcfckini) <a href=#>April 2, 2023</a></p><h2><span style=font-weight:400>KSI Apologizes for His Statement</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>On April 3, KSI took to Twitter to post an apology and announce that he would be stepping away from social media for some time. “I wanna apologise for saying a racial slur in a recent Sidemen video. There’s no excuse, no matter the circumstances, I shouldn’t have said it and I’m sorry,” he wrote.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“I’ve always said to my audience that they shouldn’t worship me or put me on a pedestal because I’m human. Im not perfect, I’m gonna mess up in life, and lately I’ve been messing up a lot. So I’ve decided I’m gonna just take a break from social media for a while,” the YouTuber added.</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.llanelliherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/119553419_ksi.jpg alt width=976 height=549 sizes="(max-width: 976px) 100vw, 976px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>This is not the first time KSI has landed in trouble for his actions. Earlier in 2012, he was accused of sexual harassment at a Eurogamer event, after <strong>which Microsoft banned him from the expo. In 2021</strong>, he was accused of using transphobic slurs; however, the boxer claimed that he did not know the words he used were ‘bad.’</span></p><h2><span style=font-weight:400>Social Media Outraged with KSI’s Racial Slur</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>A number of celebrities and fans are outraged by KSI’s comments and have slammed him on social media. Actor Guz Khan tweeted, “You see @KSI the issue you have here is that a lot of Pakistanis can make things very difficult for you and anyone giggling in this video. When they catch up with you, I hope the dead countdown joke was worth it.”</span></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Racism towards South Asians is so normalised that not only does it get laughed at, it gets shared publicly for clout. If you have to preface a racial slur with “I don’t mean this maliciously but” then you know exactly what you’re saying, so KSI had better not plead ignorance now. <a href=#>https://t.co/MivrZfrYzM</a></p><p>— Madiha (@MadihaBlob) <a href=#>April 2, 2023</a></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>A fan said, “The fact that it made it on to YouTube, many people watched that numerous times and said ‘Yeah, that’s fine.’ And I think that’s worth noting, because again it just speaks of a normalization of a certain type of racism.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“I had this racial slur thrown at me & got physical beats by racists for my entire childhood. Genuinely upset that @KSI (a guy my children love) did this & thought it was funny. The rest of them laughing can go f**k themselves too,” DJ Bobby Friction wrote.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>For more news and updates, keep watching this space.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbjAp5ylpJmdsrOty51lnKedZH5xhI6wn5qsXZm2pXnKrKBmq5Guerq71K2sm52iYsK0sdJmqZqbmZa5br%2FLrqlmoZ5iw6qwxKhkrKiRp7i0ecKopa2qn6uys7%2FYaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1443946-typical-naija-mother-funny-moment-regina-askia-gives-daughter-a-straight-face-twerking-tiktok-video.html><span>←</span><span>Typical Naija Mother: Funny Moment Regina Askia Gives Daughter a Straight Face for Twerking in TikTo</span></a>
