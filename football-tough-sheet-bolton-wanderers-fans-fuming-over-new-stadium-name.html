Bolton Wanderers fans are not impressed after the British football club announced their new, borderline x-rated stadium name.
Toughsheet, a local building product manufacturer, has signed a five-year sponsorship deal with the League One club which includes naming rights. The stadium is currently called University of Bolton Stadium.
“From the 1st July 2023, the stadium will be renamed the Toughsheet Community Stadium,” the Wanderers announced in a statement."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
