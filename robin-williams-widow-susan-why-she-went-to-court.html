She filed papers at San Francisco Superior Court asking to exclude the contents of the $7million house she shared with the actor.</p><p id=eQgthE4vCoC4 data-wc=23>According to Susan, just weeks after the actor's passing, she was told she might not even be able to keep their wedding gifts.</p><p id=essIatziSspi data-wc=92>She went on to explain the situation to presenter Amy Robach: "Two and a half weeks after Robin had left, I was still in shock. And not back in our home. After being in the trenches with my husband for so long and trying to solve this thing, after seven years together in love, I was told that I might not be able to be able to keep our wedding gifts, that in fact, 'While you're out of the house … we need to come in and take everything out,'" she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9e9db63a7eb3-robin-williams-z.jpg><p id=e8azucnPz25q data-wc=46>"I'll never forget being on the phone with one of the trustees and saying, 'What is this? I know Robin Williams is famous - he's my husband! If you guys think everything is memorabilia then take me. He's touched me. Where does this end?," she said.</p><p id=eElUkkmZO3AC data-wc=49>At the time when Susan contested the will, his three children were said to be "heartbroken that (the) petitioner, Mr Williams' wife of less than three years, has acted against his wishes by challenging the plans he so carefully made for his estate," their lawyers said in court papers.</p><p id=eY4QqqRZ1hVd data-wc=12>In October <a class=hm-link href=#>they ended their legal battle</a> but the exact details of which have not been disclosed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/55487ed9b15e-robin-williams2-z.jpg><p id=ezt-lx1AFTBN data-wc=59>However, Susan's lawyer James Wagstaffe did confirm that she will continue to live in the San Francisco Bay Area home she shared with the late star, and will receive living expenses to maintain the house for the rest of her life. Susan will also receive Robin's watch, a bike they bought together on their honeymoon and their wedding gifts.</p><p id=eKapKcwaWmsH data-wc=24>Meredith Bushnell, the lawyer acting for Robin's children, Zachary, Zelda and Cody, said: "I think they're just very happy to have this behind them."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
