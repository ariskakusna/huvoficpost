Boroughs, But What About Counties?</h3><p data-sourcepos=7:1-7:151><span>So,</span><span> you think New York City is just one big,</span><span> bustling borough?</span><span> Nope!</span><span> The Big Apple is actually made up of five fantastic boroughs:</span><span> Manhattan,</span><span> Brooklyn,</span><span> Queens,</span><span> the Bronx,</span><span> and Staten Island.</span><span> But here's the twist:</span><span> </span><strong>each borough is also its own county!</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=9:1-9:339><span>That's right,</span><span> folks.</span><span> New York City is basically a county-shaped nesting doll.</span><span> Manhattan is nestled snugly inside New York County,</span><span> Brooklyn chills in Kings County (because apparently Brooklynites are

County.</span></p><h3 data-sourcepos=11:1-11:29>Why the County Conundrum?</h3><p data-sourcepos=13:1-13:429><span>This whole borough-county thing is a leftover from way back when.</span><span> New York City wasn't always the sprawling metropolis it is today.</span><span> Each borough started as its own separate entity,</span><span> each with its own county designation.</span><span>

cares about the official title when you've got hot dog stands and Broadway shows to explore,</span><span> right?</span><span> Well,</span><span> you've got a point.</span><span> But hey,</span><span>
