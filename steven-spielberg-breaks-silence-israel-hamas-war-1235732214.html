We must remain united and steadfast in these efforts.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">As part of the Countering Antisemitism Through Testimony Collection initiative, a project that documents post-Holocaust antisemitism, the USC Shoah Foundation has spoken to several survivors, including recently the wife of <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/israeli-director-yahav-winner-dead-hamas-terrorist-attack-1235616808/>filmmaker Yahav Winner</a>, who was killed in the Oct. 7 attack.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Shaylee Atary Winner recounted the moment she escaped from her home with her 4-week-old daughter as her husband, director of The Boy, fought off a Hamas terrorist who was trying to get into their safe room.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">After taking cover in a garden shed, Shaylee said she and her daughter eventually found refuge in a neighbor’s safe room and were rescued more than a day later. But Shaylee later learned that Yahav was killed in the attack.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“When I was with Shaya in the garden shed, I told myself, ‘Shaylee, think about Holocaust films. What would a mother and a baby do?’ Because this is how it felt,” she said. “I felt like they are actually running after me and Shaya, like she is prey. … No regular situation in my regular reality could be even close to what we [were going] through.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofLTAxK%2Bcp2WjpbamuMGeqaBlkqeyorfSZqqipJWjsKZ5yKypmp2cYrWiucCsZLCZomJ%2Bc3%2BUcGpramFpfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jim-beard-dead-steely-dan-1235844833.html><span>←</span><span>Steely Dan Keyboardist Was 63</span></a>
