"It's a Catch-22," the&nbsp;Issa Album&nbsp;artist said about a minute and a half into the video, specifically addressing how difficult it can be for some artists to maintain a relationship with the neighbourhood they grew up in after getting their big break.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"It’s like, I can make it and forget about my hood, and then my hood going to be trying to kill me.&nbsp;Or, I can look out for my hood, and I can catch a RICO," he explained. "If you get on&nbsp;and turn your back on your hood, you’re a f*ck n*gga."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Overall, Savage advised rappers to be cautious when visiting the places they frequented before fame. "They gonna take your jewelry, they gonna show the world, ‘He ain’t even like that. He’s a bitch.’ If you take care of your hood, you’re a f*cking leader.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"If you want to be a n*gga hanging on the block, just know that you can get killed hanging on the block, rapper or not. That’s how it go," the "Wheelie" hitmaker told Hoffa – check it all out below.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p>About The Author</p><p>Hayley Hynes is the former Weekend Managing Editor of HotNewHipHop, she stepped down after two years in 2024 to pursue other creative opportunities but remains on staff part-time to cover music, gossip, and pop culture news.
