A member of Kodak's team tried to calm him down by saying that Malone was actually leaving the studio before deciding to wait around after hearing Kodak was on his way. "Why the fuck that fuck n***a left?" yells the Broward County rapper before explaining on Instagram Live that he was about to go viral. "I was about to walk in somebody studio session, beat they fucking ass and just go live."&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In the same video, Kodak ends up switching his tone and shooting his shot at <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Cardi B</a>'s sister Hennessy Carolina. He did so out of respect for Cardi and her husband <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Offset</a>, he said. In case Hennessy doesn't come through, his backup plan happens to be <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kim Kardashian</a> if she's ever tired "of that fuck n***a Kanye."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p><br><h2>Kodak Black & Post Malone</h2></p><p>Kodak Black Wanted To Beat Up Post Malone After Ditching Studio Session</p><p>About The Author</p><p>&lt;b>Managing Editor&lt;/b> &lt;!--BR--> Alex Zidel began working at HotNewHipHop as a Staff Writer in February 2018 before becoming the Managing Editor in June 2019. &lt;strong>Favorite Hip Hop Artists:&lt;/strong> Kid Cudi, Kanye West, Young Thug, Frank Ocean.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdhaYV0fJJmoqickaB6o7jAnKJmr5GjwaawjK2mZpqVlsFuwc9mp6irpGK6orjOp5xmmZapsrN5w6KrnKCZo7Ruv9Oum6KnXaiytL%2FIqKVmppWswA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kings-leon-jared-followill-marries-model-martha-patterson-pic-375196.html><span>←</span><span>Kings of Leon Jared Followill Marries Model Martha Patterson Pic</span></a>
