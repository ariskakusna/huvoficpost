In addition to the title song, the album of the same name, which was released as the soundtrack to the film, includes “When Doves Cry,” Let’s Go Crazy and “I Would Die 4 U” and sold over 25 million units worldwide.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The movie grossed close to $100 million worldwide and won the Academy Award for best original score. “It’s been almost 40 years since Prince’s legendary film, Purple Rain, took the world by storm and we can’t think of a more fitting tribute than to honor Prince and the Purple Rain<strong>&nbsp;</strong>legacy with this stage adaptation of the beloved story,” said L. Londell McMillan, chairman of The NorthStar Group, and Larry Mestel, founder and CEO of Primary Wave Music<strong>. </strong>“We are thrilled with our Broadway partners and creative team, who are bringing a theatricality to the film’s original fictional story. We can’t wait for a new generation to discover Purple Rain<strong> </strong>and for lovers of the original film and album to experience its power once again, this time live.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8uinZ6rpK65pnvAq6usZ6Cntq%2BvxKxkqa2ipbmmedGaoKdlo6muqLGMqamonKWYwaq7zWZoa2tlbIVyf5JsZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./north-west-makeup-kanye-west.html><span>←</span><span>North West Wants to Make YouTube Makeup Videos, but Her Parents Aren't on Board</span></a>
