She squeezes out a few dots a half-inch below her eyes and gently massages them in using her ring finger. After a month of consistent use, she “no longer wakes up with excessive puffiness under [her] eyes” and “there’s been a noticeable difference in how bright [her] under-eyes look.” My mom also mentioned that she “looks more awake even if [she hasn’t] gotten much sleep” — it gives “the illusion of eight hours of sleep in a tube.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">My mom added that the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">eye cream</a> “acts like a filter” and is “very blurring” when it comes to hiding her fine lines and has even eliminated others altogether. She even started using it as a spot treatment on other parts of her face, like on her smile lines and around her forehead. My mom also says the consistency of the cream is lightweight, non-greasy, and melts down into the skin effortlessly. After hours of wear, she doesn’t experience any irritation and her makeup applies smoothly over top with no pilling.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Shop <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Derma-E’s Hydrating Eye Cream</a> for $10 on Amazon, along with more on-sale anti-aging eye creams below.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-neutrogena-repair-retinol-eye-cream></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Neutrogena Repair Retinol Eye Cream</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-dongyu-caffeine-eye-serum-and-under-eye-roller></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Dongyu Caffeine Eye Serum and Under-Eye Roller</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57w56pppldmnqpxcOrmK2hnpx6psXEZpqrnZGierOx1aKcsGWRoq67u81mb29qYGd%2BcQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./me-milan-il-duca.html><span>←</span><span>ME Milan Il Duca Hotel Review, Milan, Italy</span></a>
