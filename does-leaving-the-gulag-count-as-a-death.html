The end of a Warzone competition is when both players have been to the gulag (up until the gulag closes) and both players are dead or the game has been won.<h2>How do deaths work in warzone?</h2>The higher the K/D, the better you're playing. Deaths caused by eliminating yourself or a teammate crashing a helicopter count towards your K/D, even though the death was not caused by losing to an enemy player.

An example of a good KD is 4.0.<h2>What is your KD If you have 0 deaths?</h2>But back to my original statement, that a kill death ratio with 0 deaths will always equal infinity. [i]To put it rather simply, as long as you have at least 1 kill, as your deaths approach 0, your Kill/death ratio approaches infinity.<h2>Does pregame lobby affect KD?</h2>Kills also count towards Daily Challenges, as well as for completing in-game Reticle Challenges and Camo Challenges. However, even though you can earn XP and gain progress by playing in this lobby, your actual K/D will not be affected.<h2>Does health regenerate in Gulag?</h2>In the Gulag your health does not regenerate.
