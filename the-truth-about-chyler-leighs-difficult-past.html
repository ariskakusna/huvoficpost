"I would go to work and use that adrenaline and expend my energy and feelings there, and then I would come home exhausted." After visiting a therapist, Leigh went on a "cocktail of prescriptions" that numbed her to everything and "completely obliterated [her] ability to manage" the life she created. This continued up until age 29, when the actor suffered a breakdown and admitted herself into a hospital for treatment.&nbsp;She was eventually diagnosed with bipolar disorder II, a condition she had tried to ignore for way too long.&nbsp;"I was constantly hiding layers of myself, trying to come off as pretty and palatable," she told Prevention.</p><p>What's sad about Leigh's case is that she knew from an early age something wasn't right.&nbsp;"When I would try to talk about how I was feeling, I don't think my parents were in a position to really listen," she told <a href=#>Healthday</a>, explaining how her mom was diagnosed as bipolar later in life. Now that Leigh has found help, she's doing better than ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, Leigh isn't the only <a href=#>star who has struggled with mental health issues</a>, and the decision to discuss them publicly is always a brave one.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmanBkZX12e9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2Ytbq4xKtkpZ2ZnLW0ecOinZ%2Bhk6q5tXnPmqqtZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1579733-stephen-langs-net-worth-age-height-family-latest-updates.html><span>←</span><span>Stephen Lang's net worth, age, height, family and latest updates</span></a>
