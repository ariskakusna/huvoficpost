And yeah, they've put it&nbsp;all&nbsp;into song. Here's a definitive list of the songs that Jelena have penned about each other and their relationship's infamous ups and downs.</p><h2 id=1-quot-love-will-remember-quot-2013-xa0-3>1. "Love Will Remember," 2013&nbsp;</h2><p>Selena released this very emotional track after the couple's first big breakup in 2013. It literally includes a voicemail he left her.</p><h2 id=2-quot-bad-day-quot-2013-3>2."Bad Day," 2013</h2><p>In case you didn't know that Jelena had bad times, Justin let you know in this track.</p><p>Justin also seemed to take responsibility for his role in the deterioration of the relationship with lyrics like, "Never thought a love like yours would leave me all alone, oh no / Didn't waste any time / But you had already made up your mind / No sympathy / Cause I was out of line, oh yeah."</p><h2 id=3-quot-nothing-like-us-quot-2013-3>3."Nothing Like Us," 2013</h2><p>But Justin was also careful to remind us that the couple had good times, like in his song "Nothing Like Us."</p><h2 id=4-quot-nobody-does-it-like-you-quot-2013-3>4."Nobody Does It Like You," 2013</h2><p>Selena acknowledged that she was into Justin's notorious bad boy rep with lyrics like, "You're my bad boy fairytale/ My rebel with a halo / You hit me like a hurricane/ And I can never say no."</p><h2 id=5-quot-come-amp-get-it-quot-2013-3>5."Come & Get It," 2013</h2><p>Many interpreted "Come & Get It" as an open invitation for Justin to come back into Selena's life.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more. Sign up here.</p><h2 id=6-quot-heartbreaker-quot-2013-3>6."Heartbreaker," 2013</h2><p>"It's a song for people going through heartbreak — like I was when I wrote it," Justin wrote on Twitter about the track. "It means so much to me to be able to share what I was, and am still going through, with my fans."</p><h2 id=7-quot-forget-forever-quot-2013-xa0-3>7."Forget Forever," 2013&nbsp;</h2><p>Selena seemed to reference the breakdown of their love in this 2013 song, singing, "Our love was made to rule the world / You came and broke the perfect girl."</p><h2 id=8-quot-all-that-matters-quot-2013-3>8."All That Matters," 2013</h2><p>Justin also wrote about the good times. Her confirmed that Selena was the inspiration behind this song during a&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liQtJZJH-vs" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>radio interview</a>&nbsp;with "'All That Matters' was written when I was in a great place in my relationship," he explained. "At that time, she was all that mattered."</p><p>Then, when asked directly if it was about Selena, Justin confirmed, "I wrote the best music once my heart was broken."</p><h2 id=9-quot-hold-tight-quot-2013-3>9."Hold Tight," 2013</h2><p>Basically, Justin spent most of 2013 pouring his feelings about Selena into song.</p><h2 id=10-quot-the-heart-wants-what-it-wants-quot-2014-3>10."The Heart Wants What It Wants," 2014</h2><p>Selena's emotional track, "The Heart Wants What it Wants," laid all of her complicated feelings for Justin on the line.</p><h2 id=11-quot-i-want-you-to-know-quot-2015-3>11."I Want You To Know," 2015</h2><p>Selena collaborated on this track with Zedd (who she briefly dated), but many fans were convinced it was about Justin.</p><h2 id=12-quot-where-are-xdc-now-quot-2015-3>12."Where Are Ü Now," 2015</h2><p>This emotional song about a lost love feels like it could only be inspired by Selena.</p><h2 id=13-quot-mark-my-words-quot-2015-3>13."Mark My Words," 2015</h2><p>Justin still seemed to be referencing a future reconciliation with Selena in this track, singing, "Trying to rekindle us / Only to lose yourself / But I won't let me lose you / And I won't let us just fade away / After all that we've been through / I'ma show you more than I ever could say."</p><h2 id=14-quot-what-do-you-mean-quot-2015-3>14."What Do You Mean?" 2015</h2><p>2015 saw a slew of songs from Justin that definitely seemed to be about Selena. This one shined a light on what he saw as her tendency to say one thing and do another when it came to their relationship.</p><h2 id=15-quot-love-yourself-quot-2015-3>15."Love Yourself," 2015</h2><p>There's strong evidence that this one is about Selena—she actually has "love yourself first"&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://onairwithryan.iheart.com/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>tattooed</a>&nbsp;in Arabic on her back. Does this mean the Biebs' mom doesn't like her? Say it isn't so.</p><h2 id=16-quot-same-old-love-quot-2015-3>16."Same Old Love," 2015</h2><p>Selena sang about a relationship that had had a LOT of ups and downs in this track, with lyrics like, "Take away your things and go / You can't take back what you said, I know / I've heard it all before, at least a million times." Hmm, who could have told her sorry "at least a million times..."?</p><h2 id=17-quot-sorry-quot-2015-3>17."Sorry," 2015</h2><p>Was it too late to say sorry? Jelena's recent rekindling would suggest that no, it was not.</p><h2 id=18-quot-friends-quot-2017-3>18."Friends," 2017</h2><p>This song, about hoping it's possible to still be friends with an ex, came out just before Justin and Selena started hanging out again. Coincidence? Maybe. But Maybe not, right?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJuVobKjvsitsGifYWiFcYCTa2tooqWowaq6jJugnpqVp3q0scuepZpll6S6psaMrKann6NirqO71K1knpmTnXqwwMeeqWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./elfcosmetics-com.html><span>←</span><span>E.l.f. promo codes - 10% OFF in July 2024</span></a>
