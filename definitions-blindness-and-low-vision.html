Clinically it is usually measured with the Snellen chart or other similar device. Visual Impairment “…may be mild or severe, but in each case visual performance does not meet the individual's needs.” Legal Blindness Federal Regulation establishes Legal Blindness: “…when the best vision obtained in the better eye, is 20/200 or less, or when, despite the acuity attained, the field of vision is 20 degrees or less.” Low Vision When ordinary eye glasses, contact lenses or intraocular lens implants cannot provide sharp sight, and an individual is said to have low vision … although reduced central or reading vision is common, low vision may also result from decreased side (peripheral) vision, a reduction of loss of color vision, or the eye's inability to properly adjust to light, contrast or glare.<p><a href=# rel=noopener>http://www.aao.org</a></p>Partially Sighted Visual acuity that when corrected is still between 20/70 and 20/200; (a person with 20/70 eyesight can clearly distinguish an object at 20 feet that a person with normal vision can clearly distinguish at 70 feet). Visual Acuity - (criterion) Certify eligibility for special services or programs - financial aid and tax credits. Legal Blindness Visual acuity that cannot be corrected to better than 20/200 and/or restricted field vision less than 20 degrees. Visual Field Loss - (criterion) Certify eligibility for special services or programs - financial aid and tax credits. Low Vision “…terms used to describe several levels of very limited sight which interfere with a person's daily routine activities, have some residual vision, may have reduced central visual acuity (sharpness of vision), with normal or good peripheral (side) vision, may have a very narrow field of view but good central acuity.”<p><a href=# rel=noopener>http://www.aoa.org</a></p><h2>Definition of Deafblindness</h2>"A combination of hearing and visual impairments causing such severe communication, developmental, and educational problems that the child cannot be accommodated in either a program specifically for the deaf or a program specifically for the Visual Impairment, including blindness: An impairment in vision that, even with correction, adversely affects a child's educational performance. The term includes both partial sight and blindness." &nbsp; —IDEA, 2004<p>"Persons who have substantial visual and hearing losses such that the combination of the two causes extreme difficulty in pursuit of educational, vocational, avocational or social goals."</p><p>—Helen-Keller World Conference on Services to Deaf-Blind Youth and Adults, 1997</p><p>"Central visual acuity of 20/200 or less in the better eye with corrective lenses or visual acuity of greater than 20/200 if the visual field is constructed to 20 degrees or less, and a physiological chronic hearing impairment so severe that most speech cannot be understood through the ear with optimum amplification.
