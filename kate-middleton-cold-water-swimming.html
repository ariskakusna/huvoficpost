All three royals talked about their past and present love of sports and fitness, but it was Princess Kate’s <a href=# id=auto-tag_swimming_1 data-tag=swimming>swimming</a> habit that definitely stole the show.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I love it,” Middleton revealed, though her penchant for cold water immersion only goes so far. “I wouldn’t quite want to be put through my paces with a freezing, sub-zero <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ice bath</a>,” she admitted.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Middleton is known for her athleticism, having played netball and hockey in high school, where she was also (of course) captain of the swim team. On the podcast, she noted that she “love[s] playing tennis” and “just being on the water” for other sports. She and Prince William “recently <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">got into playing” pickleball</a> as well.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Will and Kate are famously competitive (“I don’t think we’ve actually managed to finish a game of tennis,” Middleton said. “It becomes a mental challenge between the two of us!”) and it sounds like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">their kids</a> have inherited some of that drive. “What I think is really interesting is that they are all obviously very different temperaments,” Middleton said. Prince George, 10, Princess Charlotte, 8, and Prince Louis, 5, “are growing and trying out different sports” these days. <a tabindex=0 href=# class=lrv-u-flex@tablet><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/prince-william-kate-middleton.jpg alt="Prince William, Prince of Wales and Catherine, Princess of Wales attend a ceremonial welcome for The President and the First Lady of the Republic of Korea at Horse Guards Parade on November 21, 2023 in London, England." height width style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="c-span u-letter-spacing-015 lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase a-font-secondary-bold-s lrv-u-font-size-14 lrv-u-margin-t-050 lrv-u-margin-t-1@desktop lrv-u-margin-b-025 u-margin-tb-00@tablet lrv-u-display-block">Related story</span> <span class="c-title a-font-secondary-medium-s@mobile-max a-font-primary-xs@tablet lrv-u-line-height-normal lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-margin-b-1 u-margin-t-050@tablet lrv-u-padding-b-025 lrv-u-color-brand-primary:hover">Prince William & Kate Middleton Can't Escape the Urban Myth of Rose Hanbury</span></a></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">As for Middleton’s own fitness, it doesn’t sound like she’s slowing down any time soon. Her cold water swimming habit, while definitely not for everyone, definitely has its upsides. <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Studies</a> have found that cold water swimming has positive effects on your cardiovascular and immune systems, can improve adaptation to stress, and may have anti-depressive benefits for your mental health as well.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Princess Kate is also known to mix up her workouts. Earlier this year, she told the <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Daily Mirror</a> that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>her exercise routine</a> includes “running around after the children” and that “whenever I can squeeze in exercise I do, even jumping on the trampoline with my children before school.” She also loves playing rugby with George, Charlotte, and Louis, saying, “They all love sport and Louis is mad about rugby. They are at an age where they just love running around.” We love the variety.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">And if Princess Kate’s latest fitness routine has you considering cold water swimming, know that it does come with some risks — namely <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">cold shock and hypothermia</a>! — so make sure to start slow and only swim with others (never alone) to stay safe. As for us, well, we might be with Will on this one. We’ll stick to the heated gyms and swimming pools this winter!</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Before you go, shop these essential items for your home gym:</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/At-Home-Gym-Accessories-That-Wont-Break-the-Bank-embed.jpg alt=At-Home-Gym-Accessories-That-Wont-Break-the-Bank-embed width=640 height=360 sizes="(min-width: 87.5rem) 1000px, (min-width: 78.75rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLTEpKWor6NjsLC5jqGcmqSknXqiusNmrp6knKOytL%2BOmqmtoZOhsrR7kXFucm5lZnysrdOeZKahlJm5psDOp2Scp5yZerit056pZqunnrqutc2gZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./712817-k-michelle-claims-she-was-highest-paid.html><span>←</span><span>K.
