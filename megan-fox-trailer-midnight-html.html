Megan Fox has teamed up with Bruce Willis and Emile Hirsch for a crime thriller releasing this summer. The new movie has Fox playing a more serious role than the type she’s become known for. This time, she’s an FBI agent willing to put herself in terrible danger in order to catch a serial killer, one who is leaving a string of dead women behind them."><meta name=author content="Billy Koelling"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The new movie has Fox playing a more serious role than the type she’s become known for. This time, she’s an FBI agent willing to put herself in terrible danger in order to catch a serial killer, one who is leaving a string of dead women behind them. Midnight in the Switchgrass may be a fresh start for the actress.</p><p>See Megan Fox in the trailer for the upcoming crime thriller below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>The trailer does a good job telling us what this movie is. It seems to hit all of the crime thriller expectations and prove itself to be a gritty movie that looks like it may hit all the points audiences expect from a story of this type. Just in the trailer, we already have a feel for the character motivations for Megan Fox and Bruce Willis, an idea of the case they’re working to solve, and some hints that we may see some surprises in the movie.</p><p>In the beginning of the trailer, we saw that <a href=#>Bruce Willis</a> and Megan Fox, agents for the FBI, seem to have messed up a sting operation. Instead of watching and catching someone for prostitution, the partners were nearby while a woman was murdered. From the trailer, it looks like we’ll see Fox and Willis be motivated to get involved with the case, at least partly due to their guilt for being in a position to prevent the murder and missing it.</p><p>Like Megan Fox, <a href=#>Emile Hirsch</a> is another actor we haven’t seen a lot of in recent years. In the early 2000s, he was in Into the Wild, The Girl Next Door, and Speed Racer. But like Fox, all of his appearances in recent years haven’t drawn the same level of attention as his career used to. Midnight in the Switchgrass may be a fresh start for both of them. While Megan Fox and Bruce Willis are clearly central players for this movie, the case seems to initially belong to Emile Hirsch’s character. He plays a local police officer investigating the murders and building a serial killer case.</p><p>Megan Fox wasn’t seen often from about 2011 to 2019, but in the past two years, has been in a handful of productions. Midnight in the Switchgrass will be her biggest release in recent years and marks somewhat of a comeback for the actress. While she’s been in some <a href=#>family-friendly</a> films, like Think Like a Dog, horrors and thrillers have been in her interest. One of her next films to release will be a <a href=#>horror-thriller</a> called Til Death. That movie will have her in a revenge story, handcuffed to her dead husband and fighting off two killers who want her as their next victim.</p><p>Midnight in the Switchgrass starring Bruce Willis, Megan Fox, and Emile Hirsch is <a href=#>releasing</a> on July 23, 2021 in select movie theaters, Apple TV, and on movie rental streaming platforms. Four days later, it will be available on DVD and Blu-Ray.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2illZyur3nFqK9mrKKWtq2x0WakopyenrSpwI2hq6ak</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marten-holden-weiner-net-worth-income-html.html><span>←</span><span>Marten Holden Weiner Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
