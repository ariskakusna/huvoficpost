So it is only wise to learn how to spot them in order to save your resources. These are common traits among them.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b6720ea3960e1c14.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nigerian students elect John Ogar as new diaspora president</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>Promise of High returns with no risk: </strong>When an investment scheme promises more than normal returns given by any conventional investment opportunity, then there is a need to be suspicious of it. Ponzi schemes, a lot of times promise up to a 100% return on investments. There’s no more obvious red flag than this.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Promise of consistent returns: </strong>Normally, markets fluctuate as investment markets rise and fall over time. When a promises consistently positive returns regardless of overall market conditions, then you should be skeptical.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Unregistered: </strong>Ponzi schemes usually have no registration history with a country's financial regulators. In Nigeria for instance, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Central Bank of Nigeria and others license investment <a href=#>houses</a> to operate in the country. Where these approvals and licenses are not available, it is only possible that one might be dealing with a Ponzi scheme.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Unlicensed sellers: </strong>Legitimate investments are usually sold by licensed operators unlike in the case of Ponzi schemes which are sold by unlicensed and unapproved operators. Always reach out to regulators to verify this.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt2q7a34s9tjkg.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>2023 election: Fresh concern arises over 6.7m uncollected PVCs</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>Vague or Complex business model:</strong> It is advisable you refrain from dealing with investment schemes that finding concrete and complete information about the organisation and its representatives is a big problem. When the operations and how revenue is generated are too complex to understand, then you should be wary.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Unclear paperwork: </strong>When the mathematics of the scheme doesn't seem to be adding up, then one should be concerned. Also, errors in financial statements are also red flags.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Difficulty receiving payments:</strong> When the organisation begins to miss payments or you have difficulty making withdrawals, it is most likely a Ponzi scheme. A lot of times, they offer even higher returns to prevent investors from cashing out.</p><p class=align-left>What the experts are saying about Ponzi schemes</p><p class=align-left>Speaking on the thriving of Ponzi schemes in Nigeria, Dayo Oludare, a financial analyst said that the main reason is because of the declining economy.
