 In order to turn skid steers and compact track loaders into land clearing machines, a variety of hydraulically driven accessories are available. Mulching heads, brush cutters, heavy-duty mowers, and other hydraulically powered attachments are all highly effective. However, they may also be harmful to both the equipment and the person who uses it.
