Lil Rod worked alongside Diddy on his Love album. He accuses the Bad Boy Records mogul of groping him, making him watch explicit videos, and more. He additionally alleges that Diddy told him he slept with two fellow celebrities, though their names have been redacted.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">One of the individuals is described as "a Philadelphia rapper who dated&nbsp;<a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Nicki Minaj</a>." The other "performed at the Super Bowl and had a successful Vegas Residency." Of course, these descriptions have led social media users to speculate. Many now theorize that Diddy might have slept with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Meek Mill</a> and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Usher</a>. Since these rumors started, Meek Mill has been <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">fiercely defending his name</a> on Twitter/X, insisting that he's never had a sexual relationship with Diddy. In fact, the Philly-born MC believes that there are forces at play that want to bring him down, including DJ Akademiks.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-adam22-is-out-of-the-loop>Adam22 Is Out Of The Loop</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Amid all of the chatter, Adam22 took to Twitter/X to weigh in yesterday, admitting that he felt a bit out of the loop. The No Jumper host and adult performer likely got many demands to comment on the situation, as he frequently shares his thoughts on viral salacious rumors such as this. According to him, however, he took a brief intermission from social media just as the drama was unfolding. "I wasn’t on twitter yesterday," he wrote. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"So wait, who’s gay?"</a></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">While he may not have much to say about Diddy's love life, he did recently share some intel about <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Drake</a>'s viral explicit video, as well as rumors Drizzy leaked it himself. Adam22 told TMZ Hip Hop that he spoke with the Toronto hitmaker after the clip started making its rounds online, emphasizing that Drake <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">had nothing to do with it going public.</a> What do you think of rumors that Meek Mill and Usher were named in Diddy's latest lawsuit?
