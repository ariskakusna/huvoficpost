The film was written and directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans and stars Shawn and Marlon Wayans, of the expansive Wayans family. The family consists of <a href=#>dozens of talented</a> actors, comedians, filmmakers, and entertainers across the media landscape, arguably most well-known for creating comedy hits such as <a href=#>In Living Color</a> and the Scary Movie film series.</p><p>In White Chicks, the Wayans brothers portray a pair of FBI agents investigating a major drug trafficking syndicate, while acting as protection for a pair of wealthy socialite women. In the first act of the film, the two ‘white chicks’ sustain cosmetic injuries that force them to remain indoors for fear of the public outcry due to their incredibly vain nature. This causes a chain of events that leads to Shawn and Marlon Wayans, two black men, posing undercover publicly as white women to take the place of the missing socialites.</p><p>Using prosthetics and makeup, the Wayans brothers undergo a <a href=#>Bad Grandpa</a>-style transformation in order to blend into a crowd of young wealthy white women. The film uses a lens of comedy to examine a number of social nuances including race, gender, identity, and sexuality, while comedically poking fun at the vanity of the extremely wealthy. Though it was critically panned, the film is widely revered as one of the most iconic comedy movies of the early 2000s, leaving heaps of audiences with fond memories and comedic quotes permanently lodged within their minds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/dance-wayans-brothers-white-chicks-damon-wayans-shawn-wayans-900x506.jpg><p>The film boasts a supporting cast of John Heard, Busy Philipps, and <a href=#>Terry Crews</a> having the most fun he’s ever had in his career. The film has permeated pop culture in a number of notable ways, spawning thousands of memes and references across comedy spaces online for the last two decades. Following White Chicks, the Wayans brothers went on to create a series of prolific comedy films including Little Man, Dance Flick, and Naked.</p><p>The Wayans brothers are often noted for their films following a specific gimmick, such as the use of race-swapping prosthetics in White Chicks. In Little Man, CGI is used to make Marlon Wayans appear as a little person, and the 2019 Netflix comedy Sextuplets features Marlon Wayans channeling his inner <a href=#>Eddie Murphy</a> influences to portray six different characters on screen at once. The Wayans’ legacy continues to build now that many of the brothers have gone on to have children with acting and entertainment aspirations of their own.</p><p>Over the years there have been many talks of a possible sequel, with the Wayans brothers returning to write, direct, and star, but no official sequel appears to be under production at this time. The fans would certainly welcome another installment, however, as the film seems to be more prescient in today’s social climate than ever. For now, we’ll just have to wait and see if this cult classic can make a comeback, though its impressive streaming figures seem to suggest a sequel could be greenlit at any moment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2ivka6ur7%2BMm6morJiav7R5wZ6qrWWTpLqmsNhmqq2qlZa6qrrGZpqhmaKpwG%2B006aj</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-roman-myth-that-inspired-remus-lupins-name-in-harry-potter.html><span>←</span><span>The Roman Myth That Inspired Remus Lupin's Name In Harry Potter</span></a>
