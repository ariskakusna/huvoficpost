City of cowboys, culture, and maybe... someone you're trying to locate? Let's say this someone isn't returning your calls, and whispers on the breeze suggest they might be enjoying a complimentary stay at the local Fort Worth correctional facility. Fear not, my friend, because unlike Maverick, we're busting someone out of jail the legal way!</p><h3 data-sourcepos=5:1-5:44>Buckle Up, We're Going Inmate Hunting!</h3><p data-sourcepos=7:1-7:38>First things first, some ground rules:</p><ul data-sourcepos=9:1-11:0><li data-sourcepos=9:1-9:123>This is all above board, folks. No jailbreaks, no tunnels of love (although that might be a fun story for another time).</li><li data-sourcepos=10:1-11:0>We're assuming your fugitive friend isn't a master of disguise and is still using their real name.</li></ul><p data-sourcepos=12:1-12:39><strong>Now, let's get to the nitty-gritty!</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=14:1-14:142>There are a couple of ways to crack this case and see if your friend is chilling in a cell or chilling on a beach (hopefully not the latter).</p><p data-sourcepos=16:1-16:40><strong>Method 1: The Technological Approach</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=18:1-18:248>We live in a fancy world with fancy websites, and Fort Worth is no different. Tarrant County, the county that houses Fort Worth, has a spiffy inmate search tool that's basically a magic mirror for handcuffs and khaki jumpsuits. Here's what you do:</p><li data-sourcepos=20:1-20:228><strong>Head over to the Tarrant County Inmate Search:</strong> This might sound fancy, but it's just a website. Just punch "Tarrant County Inmate Search" into your favorite search engine and <strong>poof!</strong> Information highway to the clink.</li><li data-sourcepos=21:1-22:0><strong>Get your search on:</strong> This website lets you look for inmates by name or booking number. Think of it like a library card catalog, but for jailbirds.</li><p data-sourcepos=23:1-23:40><strong>Method 2: Talking is Key (and Free!)</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=25:1-25:70>If the internet fails you, fear not! Here are some old-school options:</p><li data-sourcepos=27:1-27:169><strong>Ring up the Fort Worth City Jail:</strong> They have a 24/7 hotline just for folks like you. Dial (817) 392-4055 and get ready to answer some questions about your friend.</li><li data-sourcepos=28:1-29:0><strong>The Fort Worth Police Department is your friend:</strong> They might have some helpful info too. Give them a jingle at (817) 392-4200.</li><p data-sourcepos=30:1-30:37><strong>Bonus Round: In Case of Emergency</strong></p><ul data-sourcepos=32:1-33:0><li data-sourcepos=32:1-33:0><strong>Hit the bricks:</strong> If it's super important to find your friend, you can always swing by the Fort Worth City Jail in person at 350 W. Belknap Street, Ft. Worth, Texas 76102. Just remember, this isn't a social call (unless jail has really changed).</li></ul><p data-sourcepos=34:1-34:230><strong>Remember:</strong> There's always a chance your friend isn't in the Fort Worth slammer. Maybe they finally took that trip to Tahiti they've always been talking about. But hey, at least you've got some tools now to do some sleuthing.</p><p data-sourcepos=36:1-36:145><strong>Now get out there and find your friend (legally)! And hey, if it turns out they are in jail, there's always writting them a funny postcard.</strong></p>2329211539836966125<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWrGWtnZOdfHN8kW1maWxfnby4ecOoZKJllp67pXnOrqtmoZZiwLC5xKilnmWZqHqquoyjmKKkj2eEb7TTpqM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./greta-gerwig-margot-robbie-barbie-win-surprise-critics-choice-1235788557.html><span>←</span><span>Greta Gerwig, Margot Robbie Accept Barbie Win in Critics Choice Surprise</span></a>
