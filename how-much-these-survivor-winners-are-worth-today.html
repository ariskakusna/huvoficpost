Wildly popular with fans, Mariano returned for Season 8, Survivor: All-Stars, Season 20,&nbsp;Survivor:&nbsp;Heroes vs. Villains,&nbsp;and finally won on Season 22,&nbsp;Survivor: Redemption Island. Oh, there's more?&nbsp;</p><p>With this legendary status in place, Mariano mentored players — alongside Sandra Diaz-Twine — for the entirety of Season 39, Survivor: Island of the Idols. Producers even made a gigantic statue of him and Diaz-Twine on the island. "You know I loved it," the celeb told&nbsp;<a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a>&nbsp;in 2019. "It was my totem. I cried, and I took pictures with it ... I couldn't believe it."</p><p>Outside of island life, Mariano tried to earn even more money through gambling. In 2007, he starred in the reality show Rob and Amber: Against the Odds, which followed Rob's "attempt to become a professional poker player under the tutelage of poker champion Daniel Negreanu," via Mariano's <a href=#>personal website</a>. The former Survivor winner is also the head of Murlonio Productions to create TV and other entertaining content. Despite the difficulty of having to leave his four daughters at home, of course Mariano decided to return for the all-winners Season 40. At this point, he might just have to build a permanent home on the island, close to his statue, of course.&nbsp;<a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a> estimates Mariano is worth $1.3M.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2hpZYZ2e8eormalpZi1bsDHnqqeZaOqv7e11aipZq%2BZo7umvtJmmKudXay8s8DHZquonJGufA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-married-at-first-sight-australia-stars-paid.html><span>←</span><span>How much are the Married at First Sight Australia stars paid?</span></a>
