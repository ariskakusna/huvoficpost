She wore a white, off-the-shoulder ruched high-low gown that resembled a wedding dress. Puff sleeves and a bubble skirt gave the piece an '80s flair, and a white lace veil over a baseball cap inscribed with the worlds "1st is love" drove home the bridal effect.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The smock was unexpectedly paired with sneakers while Bella carried lace-up heels in one hand and a sparkly clutch in the other.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Fall 2022 show was a star-studded affair with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Rihanna</a> and A$AP Rocky, Idris Elba, Pharrell Williams, and more sitting front row. The stacked talent lineup — including Kendall Jenner, Cindy Crawford, Karlie Kloss, Serena Williams, Joan Smalls, and Naomi Campbell — all strutted down the runway wearing the late founder's designs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bella took to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Instagram</a> on Wednesday to share a gallery of images and videos from the special show and a tribute to Virgil. "To open this couture section meant everything to me," she wrote in the caption. "Not only because V had been making this dress for over a year , he made it knowing exactly what his plan was. Every piece he designed , he already knew who would embody each look. Who he wanted to embody each piece. I felt him from the top of my hat to the bounce of the sole in my sneakers. Waiting in line up, unsure of the chaos around me without him there to be the calm in the storm,I really felt I couldn't do it without him until I walked onto the runway. Something came over me+I really felt him. I know we all did."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Bella has had a busy month of shows for major designers, the model has made quite the splash off the runway, as well. Her arsenal of street style looks has included an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>arm wallet minidress</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>high-waisted underwear</a>, and a Louis Vuitton chainmail top. Most recently, she stepped out in the City of Love with her boyfriend <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Marc Kalman</a>. In photos obtained by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4>Daily Mail</a>, Bella was spotted wearing a cropped leather top and baggy cargo pants, completed with a green knit head scarf that covered the top of her brunette tresses.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e8Geo6WZXZ2upbXDaJmepJyWeqmtw6KbZq%2BVmbGqusZmm6udo6h6sLLFZq6hoaSaerS0zrA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alexis-cruz-net-worth-income-salary-html.html><span>←</span><span>Alexis Cruz Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
