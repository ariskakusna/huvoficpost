But, there are some conditions.&nbsp;</p><p>“It depends on the script, what the story is,” the actor told Bensinger. “I am a huge comic book fan, always have been. I’ve read comic books since I was 9 or younger. And I’m pretty knowledgeable about a lot of them. And I like the genre, and I like when they’re done well.”</p><p>Saying he loved Black Panther and that he watches FX’s&nbsp;Legion, Hamm said he has yet to have any official conversation about perhaps playing Batman, but “I’d probably fit the suit. I’d have to work out a lot, which I don’t love. But, I am sure there’s an interesting version of that being out there. And if they wanted to tap me on the shoulder and ask me to do it, why not?”&nbsp;</p><p>Bensinger said there have been murmurs among fans for years who believe Hamm would make a great Bruce Wayne/Batman. Hamm said he was aware.&nbsp;</p><p>“I have had rumors about that since probably season one of Mad Men,” he said. “I have never had a conversation with anybody about it, literally. And I’ve sat in the room with all these guys. I have never been offered anything. I think the internet wants what it wants. But, I mean, a lot of people have to sign off on that, obviously not just the internet.”&nbsp;</p><p>For the moment, Ben Affleck is donning&nbsp;the cape and cowl on the big screen for Warner Bros.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofKu7zWafmqWdYsCixdJmn55lmah6qrrTnqmeq6SasW68y5qwoqaXYq%2BiwMyapWZpYWl%2FeH2WaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lyrics-jenny-from-the-block-jlo.html><span>←</span><span>Jenny from the block jlo lyrics</span></a>
