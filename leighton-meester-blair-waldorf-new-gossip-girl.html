In a new interview, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=noopener>Leighton Meester</a>, who stars in Netflix's thriller The Weekend Away, said that she's not ruling out a comeback for her iconic character. Speaking to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=noopener>Fox 5 New York's Rosanna Scotto</a>, Meester explained that she's seen the new take on the Upper East Side's elite and that she's sure that there's a way for Blair to come back, it's just up to where the show's creators want to take things.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"This has been asked a couple times, I'm going, 'I don't know, maybe,'" she said. She went on to explain that she loves that the show is different enough from the original to have its own identity and that the new cast is great. And for all the fans of Queen B, Meester said that she feels like Blair could be integrated into the new crew absolutely seamlessly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"You know, I'm not really sure. I will say I've watched the new one, I do think it's really awesome. I'm happy for them, I feel like they're doing a whole new thing, and I don't think that we don't fit in but — I can only speak for myself — I don't feel like I don't fit in," she added.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Meester went on to say that she's not rushing to text creators Joshua Safran and Stephanie Savage just yet. Fans of the reboot know that Blair and her frenemy Serena van der Woodsen haven't been on camera, but their names have been tossed around. Meester is confident that the new cast can hold their own, too, saying that they're "awesome."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"But I will say, I feel really good sort of sitting back and leaving it to the kids, to the young new generation, they're doing so awesome," Meester finished. "So, that's all I'll say for now, you know ... you never say never."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e8ueoKCgpKS7brnEnqqtnaJir62tyKtksJmcmbyzsoynnLBll6TAtLXPZp6iqpw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1562204-kelechi-udegbe-gratitude-god-survives-a-ghastly-auto-crash-ruined.html><span>←</span><span>Kelechi Udegbe Gives Gratitude to God As He Survives a Ghastly Auto Crash: It Almost Ruined Me</span></a>
