comes in,</span><span> and let me tell you,</span><span> that Tennessee whiskey is smoother than a catfish in a tuxedo.</span></p><p data-sourcepos=5:1-5:207><span>But before you start hittin' the dusty trail in your best Daisy Dukes,</span><span> you gotta know </span><strong>how far you're ramblin'</strong><span>.</span><span> Don't worry,</span><span> sugar,</span><span> we'll get you there without a hitch (and hopefully without a hangover!</span><span>).</span></p><p data-sourcepos=7:1-7:63><strong>The Distance Between Your Dreams and a JD Sippin' Good Time</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=9:1-9:92><span>The good news is,</span><span> Jack Daniel's Distillery ain't exactly a million miles away.</span><span> In fact,</span><span> it's practically a hop,</span><span> skip,</span><span> and a jump from Music City.</span><span> Depending on which route you take (and how many scenic detours you make for those adorable roadside antique stores),</span><span> you're lookin' at a trip between </span><strong>73 and 82 miles</strong><span>.</span><span> That translates to roughly </span><strong>1.5 hours</strong><span> of cruisin' in your car,</span><span> with the wind in your hair and the promise of a delicious reward at the end.</span></p><p data-sourcepos=11:1-11:319><strong>Now, here's the thing:</strong><span> There are a couple of different ways to get there,</span><span> each with its own charm.</span><span> You can take the interstate,</span><span> which is all about speed (gettin' you to that whiskey faster,</span><span>
