They attempted to collaborate on what was meant to be Love's 2010 solo album Nobody's Daughter (it was ultimately released as a <a href=#>Hole</a> album, despite not featuring any other original members), but Corgan soon regretted the decision. As <a href=#>The Guardian reported</a> later that year, the pair got into a juvenile tit-for-tat on Twitter, with Corgan telling Love to "go [somewhere] nice and live off [Kurt Cobain's] money." He had apparently changed his mind about the songs he helped her write for the album, having told Rolling Stone that he did not give her permission and had "no interest in supporting her in any way, shape or form. You can't throw enough things down the abyss with a person like that."</p><p>In an apparent switch from writing awful lyrics to posting awful tweets, Corgan added a pseudo-poetic insult to his Twitter tirade: "Burn up in the sun that laughs at [you] as equally as it appears to celebrate [you and] sleep knowing [you] have no honour." Courtney compared dealing with Billy to taking "a white hot knife to the belly" (stop, both of you, please, just stop) and then pulled a manic U-turn a few days later, apologizing and claiming that they had "again created beauty from the agony between [them]." (Seriously. Stop it.)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2BlG5paWhfqbWmedOrrK2gXZavsMHTZpmipJyueqS70aCYp2WRo7Fur86uqa2mla56rbvVnqpmqpWhrrW1zqeqoaGgZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tory-burch-aw24.html><span>←</span><span>The Fashion Week Cheat Sheet: Tory Burch AW24</span></a>
