This pricing allows the band to pursue a multi-layered strategy of offsets and investments that combined, will allow for a more comprehensive mitigation plan.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Stone Gossard explains,</strong> “We are proud of our prior efforts to mitigate our inevitable carbon footprint from touring over the past 20 years but the time to multiply that effort is clearly right now.&nbsp; By committing to this aggressive pricing, we hope to equally amplify our efforts and gather partners who share our urgency to make the investments and innovations required to move our world to a more conscious, carbon balanced economy.” &nbsp;<a href=#>Learn more about the band’s history with carbon mitigation.</a></p><p><strong>Pearl Jam’s full 2022 North American Tour dates are as follows:</strong></p><table class=wp-block-table><tbody><tr><td><strong>DATE</strong></td><td><strong>CITY</strong></td><td><strong>VENUE</strong></td><td><strong>TYPE</strong></td></tr><tr><td>May 3</td><td>San Diego, CA</td><td>Viejas Arena&nbsp;</td><td>Postponed Date</td></tr><tr><td>May 6</td><td>Los Angeles, CA</td><td>The Forum</td><td>Postponed Date</td></tr><tr><td>May 7</td><td>Los Angeles, CA</td><td>The Forum</td><td>Postponed Date</td></tr><tr><td>May 9</td><td>Glendale, AZ</td><td>Gila River Arena</td><td>Postponed Date</td></tr><tr><td>May 12</td><td>Oakland, CA</td><td>Oakland Arena</td><td>Postponed Date</td></tr><tr><td>May 13</td><td>Oakland, CA</td><td>Oakland Arena</td><td>Postponed Date</td></tr><tr><td>May 16</td><td>Fresno, CA</td><td>Save Mart Arena</td><td>New Date</td></tr><tr><td>May 18</td><td>Sacramento, CA</td><td>Golden 1 Center</td><td>New Date</td></tr><tr><td>May 20</td><td>Las Vegas, NV</td><td>MGM Grand Garden Arena</td><td>New Date</td></tr><tr><td>September 1</td><td>Quebec City, QC</td><td>Videotron Centre</td><td>Postponed Date</td></tr><tr><td>September 3</td><td>Ottawa, ON</td><td>Canadian Tire Centre</td><td>Postponed Date</td></tr><tr><td>September 6</td><td>Hamilton, ON</td><td>FirstOntario Centre</td><td>Postponed Date</td></tr><tr><td>September 8</td><td>Toronto, ON</td><td>Scotiabank Arena</td><td>Postponed Date</td></tr><tr><td>September 11</td><td>New York, NY</td><td>Madison Square Garden</td><td>Postponed Date</td></tr><tr><td>September 14</td><td>Camden, NJ</td><td>Waterfront Music Pavilion</td><td>New Date</td></tr><tr><td>September 16</td><td>Nashville, TN</td><td>Bridgestone Arena</td><td>Postponed Date</td></tr><tr><td>September 18</td><td>St. Louis, MO</td><td>Enterprise Center</td><td>Postponed Date</td></tr><tr><td>September 20</td><td>Oklahoma City, OK</td><td>Paycom Center</td><td>Postponed Date</td></tr><tr><td>September 22</td><td>Denver, CO</td><td>Ball Arena&nbsp;</td><td>Postponed Date</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>About Pearl Jam</strong></p><p>2020 officially marked 30 years of Pearl Jam performing live. Eleven studio albums, hundreds of unique live performances and official live concert bootleg releases later, the band continues to be critically acclaimed and commercially successful — with over 85 million albums sold worldwide. Pearl Jam was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2017.&nbsp;</p><p>Pearl Jam’s latest album Gigaton was released in March 2020. Featuring fan favorites “Dance of the Clairvoyants,” “Superblood Wolfmoon,” and “Quick Escape” the album debuted #1 on Billboard’s Top Rock Albums, Top Alternative Albums, and Billboard Vinyl Albums Chart. In addition it hit Top 5 on Billboard 200 Album Chart, #2 Billboard Top Album Sales Chart and to date has reached over 200 million global streams. The album was critically acclaimed with Entertainment Weekly raving, “It’s a sturdy rock album from five guys who know what they’re doing, took time till they had something to say, are interpolating new influences and sound stocked to be back together in a room.”</p><p><strong>About Pluralone</strong></p><p>The third full-length Pluralone album This Is The Show will be released on March 17. The music video for the track, “The Fight For The Soul”, will also premiere on that day. “This Is The Show started as one thing, wound up another,” says Josh on the album. “In my mind, it was gonna be about something specific, kinda turned out that way, and kinda…actually most certainly turned out to be something completely different. Something far greater than I could’ve ever imagined. It was made with a lot of love and a lot of care over another unsure and uneasy year.”</p><p>Pluralone will be performing a livestream show on March 19 at 6pm PT/9pm ET which fans can register for<a href=#> here</a>. Tickets can be bundled with a digital download of This Is The Show for an additional $5 charge. Fans can also buy tickets for an “after party” performance – a stripped down/acoustic set of covers and originals by request. The album preorder link is<a href=#> here</a>.</p><p>In addition to Pluralone, Josh fronts the group Dot Hacker, and is currently a member of Pearl Jam and Eddie Vedder’s band The Earthlings. Josh is a former member of Red Hot Chili Peppers, Ataxia, Warpaint and The Bicycle Thief, along with having recorded and toured with many artists including PJ Harvey, Beck, the Butthole Surfers, and Sparks.</p><p>Pluralone played an unforgettable first live show at Ohana Encore in October 2021. Jeff Ament and Nate Walcott from Bright Eyes both made guest appearances. Josh also played with Pearl Jam and Eddie Vedder at both Ohana Fest and Ohana Encore for a marathon total of 6 sets over the two weekends.</p><p>Josh continued to play with Eddie Vedder, recently wrapping up an incredibly unique tour across the US with the Earthlings (Eddie Vedder, Josh Klinghoffer, Chad Smith, Andrew Watt, Chris Chaney, and Glen Hansard). He co-wrote and performed on Eddie Vedder’s recent chart-topping album Earthling.</p><p><strong>About Live Nation Entertainment</strong></p><p>Live Nation Entertainment (NYSE: LYV) is the world’s leading live entertainment company comprised of global market leaders: Ticketmaster, Live Nation Concerts, and Live Nation Sponsorship.
