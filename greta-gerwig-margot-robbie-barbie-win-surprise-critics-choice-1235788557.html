While the film won a total of six awards, only one of those categories (best song for “I’m Just Ken”) was presented onstage with the winners able to give an acceptance speech.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Later in the show, Handler surprised attendees and viewers — and the Barbie folks — by rectifying that.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Earlier tonight, Barbie was awarded best comedy, but it wasn’t onstage, so I’m gonna go rogue because I feel like Greta and Margot deserve the opportunity to make an acceptance speech,” Handler said toward the end of the show, with about 30 minutes left in the three-hour ceremony. “So ladies, would you mind coming up here and accepting the award for best comedy?”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Gerwig and Robbie appeared surprised at the move and unaware that it was happening.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Oh, this is so unexpected,” Robbie told the crowd from the stage. “You know, when everyone’s like, ‘Oh, this is so unexpected,’ this is actually unexpected. This was not a part of the show, but we’re very grateful nonetheless.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Gerwig added, “Thank you so much for letting this happen. We were just very excited in our chairs, and it’s very nice to be up here.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Before Handler brought Gerwig and Robbie onstage, James Mangold also made a reference to the fact that the best comedy award winners were not allowed to come onstage. While <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">introducing</a> the career achievement award winner, Harrison Ford, the Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director noted as an aside: “Why don’t they get to come onstage for comedies?” before continuing his speech.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">A source close to the show told The Hollywood Reporter that Handler, along with her writers and the show producers, made the call during a commercial break to bring the Barbie duo up onstage. Because the show was running ahead of schedule, they made the decision collectively to bring them up onstage rather than add another bit or joke.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Barbie also won best original screenplay for Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, best production design for Sarah Greenwood and Katie Spencer, best costume design for&nbsp;Jacqueline Durran and best hair and makeup.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The 29th annual <a href=# id=auto-tag_critics-choice-awards-2_1 data-tag=critics-choice-awards-2>Critics Choice Awards</a> were handed out Sunday night at Barker Hangar in Santa Monica. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">See a full list of winners.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofKi%2BxK2YZp%2BVp8Sqs4ymmKufn6l6s7vBm6CeZZKWv6O1xGauoqZdqMKzvNGiqp5lk6e2tbXCrGScoJ%2BesKZ5kGtqbm9obYJ2g44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dione-mariani-net-worth-305218.html><span>←</span><span>Dione Mariani Net Worth</span></a>
