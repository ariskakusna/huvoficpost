A Guide to the Most Dangerous Origami You'll Ever Fold (Except Maybe That Creepy Swan)</h2><p data-sourcepos=3:1-3:422>Let's face it, we've all dreamt of being a ninja. Stealing through the night, hidden in black, a master of silent but deadly force. But where do you even begin? Throwing stars? Katanas? Well, hold your horses, grasshopper (or cockroach, depending on your stealth level) because we're starting small. We're starting with the art of the humble <strong>paper ninja star</strong> (also known as a shuriken, but that sounds less dramatic).</p><h3 data-sourcepos=5:1-5:72>Why Paper? Because Real Ninja Stars Are Totally Illegal (and Pointy)</h3><p data-sourcepos=7:1-7:334>Let's be honest, throwing a metal star around the house is a recipe for disaster (especially if you have siblings or pets who like to chase things). Paper is the safe, socially-acceptable alternative. Plus, it's ninja training on a budget! You won't believe how many deadly stars you can whip up with a single sheet of printer paper.</p><h3 data-sourcepos=9:1-9:64>Step 1: Assembling Your Arsenal (a.k.a. Grabbing Some Paper)</h3><p data-sourcepos=11:1-11:69>This is where things get real, James Bond. You'll need the following:</p><ul data-sourcepos=13:1-15:0><li data-sourcepos=13:1-13:247><strong>Paper:</strong> Printer paper is fine, but for that extra bit of shuriken-throwing flair, consider construction paper. Maybe black for that classic ninja look? Or go wild with neon colors to confuse your enemies (or just stain the walls, whichever).</li><li data-sourcepos=14:1-15:0><strong>Scissors (Optional):</strong> If you're a folding origami purist, you can skip this. But if you're like me and slightly impatient, feel free to cut your paper into squares. Just remember, a wonky square makes a wonky ninja star, so keep it neat-ish.</li></ul><p data-sourcepos=16:1-16:161><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Fold a bunch of stars at once. Trust me, you'll be surprised how addictive throwing these things becomes (especially at unsuspecting wastebaskets).</p><h3 data-sourcepos=18:1-18:100>Step 2: Folding Fury - Unleashing Your Inner Origami Master (or Just Following the Instructions)</h3><p data-sourcepos=20:1-20:234>There are a ton of different origami ninja star folds out there. This guide will focus on a classic four-pointed design. Here's the gist (but for the full glory of step-by-step instructions, check out some origami tutorials online):</p><li data-sourcepos=22:1-22:80>Fold, crease, unfold, repeat. It's like origami meditation, but way cooler.</li><li data-sourcepos=23:1-23:58>Make some triangles. Because pointy things are scary.</li><li data-sourcepos=24:1-24:56>Flip, fold, tuck – basically ninja moves for paper.</li><li data-sourcepos=25:1-26:0>Behold! Your papery weapon of choice awaits your command.</li><p data-sourcepos=27:1-27:146><strong>Important Note:</strong> If you get lost at any point, don't panic. Channel your inner ninja and persevere. Or, you know, just unfold and try again.</p><h3 data-sourcepos=29:1-29:77>Step 3: The Art of the Throw - Because Throwing Paper Like a Boss is Key</h3><p data-sourcepos=31:1-31:123>Now that you have your arsenal, it's time to unleash your inner throwing star master. Here are some things to keep in mind:</p><ul data-sourcepos=33:1-36:0><li data-sourcepos=33:1-33:97><strong>Grip it and Rip It (But Gently):</strong> Hold the star by a point, with your thumb and forefinger.</li><li data-sourcepos=34:1-34:140><strong>The Not-So-Silent But Deadly Throw:</strong> Imagine you're throwing a fastball, but with a much cooler arm motion (because, you know, ninja).</li><li data-sourcepos=35:1-36:0><strong>Practice Makes Perfect:</strong> Don't expect to become a bullseye-hitting star-thrower overnight. Keep practicing and soon those wastebaskets won't stand a chance.</li></ul><p data-sourcepos=37:1-37:272><strong>Bonus Tip:</strong> If you master the basic throw, experiment with different throwing techniques for added ninja flair. Just remember, throwing stars at your friends is generally not considered good etiquette (unless they specifically ask you to, in which case, go for it!).</p><p data-sourcepos=39:1-39:240>There you have it! You're now on your way to becoming a paper-flinging ninja master. Remember, with great power comes great responsibility...and the occasional paper cut. But hey, at least you'll be the coolest origami artist on the block.</p>2023-02-08T06:40:22.336+05:30<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWrGWtnZOdfHN8kW1maWtfnby4edOoZKehnp%2Bubr%2FTmqlnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-do-you-spawn-a-gfi-element-in-ark-html.html><span>←</span><span>How do you spawn a GFI element in Ark?</span></a>
