Before the event, he revealed the origin of his finishing move, the Helluva Kick.</p><p>Sami Zayn recently appeared in an interview with<a href=#> Love Wrestling</a> where he discussed his <a href=#>return to Montréal</a> among many other things. Sami also spoke about the origin of his finishing move, the Helluva Kick.</p><p>Sami Zayn revealed that the inspiration for the Helluva Kick came from a WCW magazine during his childhood. He reached the conclusion to name his finisher after a discussion over dinner with pro wrestler Excalibur.</p><p>“It’s based on, if you want the actual history here, I don’t know if I’ve ever actually told it in an interview but what it is, is when I was a kid I had a WCW magazine and I was reading some match results and it said Chris Jericho defeated Syxx, or maybe it was the other way around, with a hell of a kick. It was written ‘helluva’ like that and I thought it was a Helluva Kick, so I thought it was a type of kick. So, I told this story to Excalibur, who now does commentary on AEW every Wednesday, but I told this story to him at dinner one time at Dani’s after a PWG show and then we started calling the running Yakuza Kick in the corner that I would do at the time, we started calling it the Helluva Kick. So, that’s actually the real history of that name,”</p><p>Sami Zayn has proven that he could hold his own with segments bringing in viewers despite the absence of The Tribal Chief. <a href=#>His popularity has caused WWE to change plans for Sami Zayn at tonight’s Elimination Chamber.</a></p><p>It remains to be seen what WWE has in store for Sami Zayn.
