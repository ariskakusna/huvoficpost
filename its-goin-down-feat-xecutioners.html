 Jan 9th 2010 !⃝ My interpretation of the song is that mike is explaining the linkin park music.
&#34;It's going down
The rhythm projects 'round the next sound
Reflects the complex hybrid dialect now
Detect the mesh of many elements compressed down
The melting pot of a super-futuresque style&#34;
Hes explaining how the beats sound pot of hybrid rhythms of genres melted down into their own sound&#34;"><meta name=author content="Tandra Barner"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

I think he might be saying how its easy to hear which is rock and which parts are rap and how their mixed at some points are logically done. Like when he's rapping you hear less rock,when its a powerful rock chorus or bridge you hear loud guitars..gritty singing/screaming etc..</p><p>"The separation narrowed down to a fine line"</p><p>This pretty much explains itself. "The seperation narrowed down to a fine line". The rap is rap and rock is rock.</p><p>"To blur the edges so they blend together properly<br>Take you on an audible odyssey now<br>It's going down"</p><p>To blur the genres together in a proper way to fit and take you on an audible odyssey adventure.</p><p>"It's going down<br>Once again it is<br>Composed sentences all together venomous<br>The four elements of natural force<br>Projected daily through the sound of the source"</p><p>Rapping and rock vocals composed together in a venomous form. Four elemetns of natural force projected daily through the sound of the source probally means four specific sounds together re written and re made daily by the source of the music linkin park. ( It's a wide known fact that they spend lots of time on their music )</p><p>"Everybody on board with this blend<br>The sword with the pen<br>The mightiest is the weapons<br>Swinging right from the chin"</p><p>The first line he's talkin about how everyone listens as they blend their rock and rap sounds together. The sword with the pen means his pen that he writes with is like a weapon.</p><p>"The elevate of mental states<br>Long gone with the wind<br>To defend men for shoddy imitation pretends"</p><p>The elevate of mental states means each song is talkin about their mental state and when they heal from whatever and make a new album their music to them seems like a mental state that's long gone with the wind. The last line is just somethin to rhyme.</p><p>"It's going down<br>Style assimilation readily<br>Trekking through the weaponry<br>Of the pure pedigree"</p><p>Talking about how they have their main style ready before they trek through their pure sound and mix it more. For example their mainly rap/rock but some songs have electronica, screaming,and they pretty much go crazy with whatever they want. Compare qwerty to in pieces then compare that to forgotten then to a place for my head and you'll see their like different bands.</p><p>"Cleverly seeing through whatever is ahead of me<br>Whatever the weather be<br>We invent the steadily"</p><p>They do their sound whatever gets in their way for example their first label tried to change them but thye kept on.</p><p>"It's going down to sub-terrestrial high<br>I rhyme regiment that's calling the shots<br>Execution of collaborative plots<br>Ready to bring the separation of style to a stop<br>It's going down<br>"<br>It's happening (or doing down) and they're gonna go all the way to the top. People always separate genres (rock is rock rap is rap) but their gonna bring that to a stop with a new sound.</p><p>Well that's my interpretation peace</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rcXRopqipqSav7G%2BxK2YraGfo8Bvr86mZqWhnqC2r3nPmqmkZ5mpwG6zzqKlZpyfrLtussSaq2awlZjCtbXOp5yrqw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kenny-schrader-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Kenny Schrader Net Worth 2024</span></a>
