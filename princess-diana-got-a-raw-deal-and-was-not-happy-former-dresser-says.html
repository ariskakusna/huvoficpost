The two browsed the shop like any other customers, even though Diana’s profile was on the rise after her recent engagement to Charles. After the visit to the boutique, Rhodes got an unexpected call from British Vogue, asking her to submit a design for Diana’s royal wedding dress. “While Zandra’s black corset sketch never became the royal wedding dress, it did end up in the possession of perhaps the next most famous Diana—Diana Ross,” The Daily Mail writes.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Gk8cZBdUmYqnpHJPPFJSqR-1920-80.jpg><p>Though Elizabeth and David Emanuel ended up winning the competitive bid to design Diana’s wedding dress, Rhodes and the Princess of Wales would work together five times in total, including in 1986, when Diana returned to Rhodes’ shop and picked out a black dress to be remade in pink. “The garment became one of the statement pieces worn by Diana during an official visit to Japan that same year,” The Daily Mail reports.</p><p>Of working with Diana, Rhodes said “You get let into the palace with this dress over your arm and you do a curtsy, and you bump into the children’s toys,” she said, adding of Diana that “Happy wasn’t a word I would have associated with her, but she was very warm.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YK2kwxB9eipuHTQZyAmKma-1920-80.jpg><p>Diana may have been Princess of Wales, but <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.tatler.com/article/zandra-rhodes-princess-diana referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>Tatler</u> </a>calls Rhodes the Princess of Punk.
