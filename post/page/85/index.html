<a href=../../../can-i-put-a-sealer-over-latex-paint-html.html></a>
Answer
The use of latex paint normally does not need the use of additional sealers. Applying a clear topcoat over a latex-painted surface, on the other hand, aids in sealing and protecting the surface area. Clear sealants may also be used to offer an extra layer of protection to faux-painted walls.
Is it possible to apply a clear coat over latex paint in the same way? Polyurethane comes in two forms: oil-based and water-based.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Can I Take A Train From London To Switzerland</h2><time>Aug 17, 2024</time>

My relationship with acne is the longest one I've been in. I've dealt with hormonal breakouts since college and I've even taken spironolactone to help get my skin under control. After a never-ending cycle of pimples, I finally figured out the key to keeping my skin (mostly) clear: a consistent simple skincare routine and managing my stress as much as possible.
