<a href=../../../what-drops-the-sniper-rifle-in-terraria-html.html></a>
Answer
In Hardmode, the Sniper Rifle has a 7.64 percent / 11.46 percent chance of dropping from Skeleton Snipers, which can only be found in Dungeon regions with Slab Walls once Plantera has been slain.
When it comes to Terraria, how uncommon is the sniper rifle in terms of availability? It can only be discovered in the Post-Plantera Dungeon, where it is dropped by the Skeleton Sniper, a rare monster that can only be found in the dungeon’s slab walls, among Rusty Armored Bones and other similar enemies.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>What Happened To Latruth?</h2><time>Aug 23, 2024</time>
