Doja Cat recently hopped on Instagram, teasing a new music video that she has on the way. In the clip, Doja walks into a spooky shower in some red heels, and looks to be washing blood off of herself. As blood begins to pool in the shower drain, the words "'Agora Hills' coming soon" flash across the screen. By the looks of things, the new music video should be something straight out of a horror movie, which makes sense considering her other recent releases.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Dominik Mysterios NXT North American Title Match Set For No Mercy</h2><time>Aug 7, 2024</time>

These trucks can (and do) regularly hit 200,000 miles. The truck and drivetrain will only last as long as you maintain it, though. There are parts that fail, just like anything else. But regular maintenance (fluid changes, body upkeep, hard part care) will help you have a very long relationship with your truck. How many miles can you get on a Allison transmission? With no programmer and standard maintenance you are looking at 200K-400K miles.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How much does it cost to build a gabion wall?</h2><time>Aug 7, 2024</time>
