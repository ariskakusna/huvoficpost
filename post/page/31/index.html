<a href=../../../why-does-my-kohler-toilet-whistle-html.html></a>
Answer
A toilet that whines after you flush it or at odd intervals throughout the night is typically caused by a malfunctioning fill valve that has to be replaced. As a fill valve ages, the interior components may degrade, resulting in the whistling and hissing noises that most people experience when they have this condition.
Additionally, individuals inquire as to why their toilet makes a high-pitched noise. Whatever the sound is, whether it’s a little whistle or an ear-piercing scream, the high-pitched sound you hear when your toilet refills indicates that either the fill valve gasket needs to be replaced or that you need a new valve.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Why Enrique Iglesias Will No Longer Release Any More Albums</h2><time>Aug 27, 2024</time>
