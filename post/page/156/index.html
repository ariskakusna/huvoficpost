I'm your average dreamer
I'm a true escapist
Always expecting a happy endingMaybe I've been watching
Too many movies
Maybe I should grow up
And stop pretending
When I saw your face though
Everything was slow-mo
And I started wondering why... CHORUS:
Why can't it be
Just a pathway full of roses
Leading to a sunset view
Where the one you've always dreamed of waits
Why can't it be
It was like a movie scene The way I felt for you</article><article class=post-entry><h2>'Ready Player One' &amp;quot;Dreamer&amp;quot; Trailer</h2><time>Aug 5, 2024</time>

Light is better than dark!
The color of your car's interior can have a huge impact on how hot your car gets. This chart below, courtesy of Safe Kids, shows how on a 79 degree day, the vehicle with a light colored interior will stay much cooler than one with a dark colored interior. Are black leather car seats hot? This is especially true for black leather, as surface temperatures can reach close to 200 degrees.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Ashley Gorley Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</h2><time>Aug 5, 2024</time>
