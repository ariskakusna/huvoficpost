Back in 2020, Kelly even appeared on a remix to Harlow's "What's Poppin."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As for <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Kelly's relationship with Eminem</a>, the two have had beef for many years. The animosity stems from a tweet Kelly posted about Eminem’s daughter, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel="nofollow noopener">Hailie Mathers</a>, back in 2012. Kelly later dissed him on <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Tech N9ne</a>’s 2018 song “No Reason.” In response, Eminem took aim at him on his Kamikaze song, "Not Alike." He rapped, "He wants to keep up his tough demeanour / So he does a feature, decides to team up with N9na (Yeah) / But next time you don’t gotta use Tech N9ne / If you wanna come at me with a sub, Machine Gun / And I’m talkin’ to you But you already know who the fuck you are, Kelly / I don’t use sublim’s and sure as fuck don’t sneak-diss / But keep commenting on my daughter Hailie I keep on telling motherfuckers / But, just in case you forgot really and need Ja memories jarred / like strawberry or pineapple apricot jelly / I respond rarely, but this time Shady ’bout to sound off."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong><span>Quotable Lyrics:</span></strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The truth is my closest tried to cross me like Judas<br>But can't cross me like I'm Jewish<br>The Crosshair's a little shakey, they missed me by two inch</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Cole Blake is currently an Editor at HotNewHipHop based out of Brooklyn, New York.
