It usually doesn't cause hair loss, but it can cause previously detached hair to fall away from your scalp more easily.<h2>Can coconut oil clog your hair follicles?</h2>Coconut oil may clog pores and cause irritation for some scalp types (just as it does on certain skin types), and is best used directly on the hair and not the scalp (of those with the right type of hair).<h2>How many times a week should I put coconut oil in my hair?</h2>"When applied on a regular basis (two to three times per week if your hair type is normal to coarse; less often if you have fine hair), coconut oil can enhance hair's lubrication, making it easier to comb and manage, while increasing shine and preventing frizz," explains GH Beauty Lab senior chemist Sabina Wizemann.<h2>Which oil is best for fast hair growth?</h2><p>Best Hair Oils For Hair Growth</p><li>Castor Hair Oil: Castor oil is rich in vitamin E, proteins, minerals. ...</li><li>Bhringraj Hair Oil: Bhringraj oil is made from combining Eclipta alba or False Daisy with sesame oil. ...</li><li>Olive Hair Oil: ...</li><li>Sesame Hair Oil: ...</li><li>Argan Hair Oil: ...</li><li>Jojoba Hair Oil: ...</li><li>Coconut Hair Oil:</li><h2>What oil makes your hair grow the fastest?</h2>1.
