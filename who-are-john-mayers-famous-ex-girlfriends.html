But the song came out a year before the pair started dating, so anyone paying attention would know that's not the case. Afterward, Mayer dated songster Vanessa Carlton for about a year, per <a href=#>Wonderwall</a>, and she later called him a "bad breaker-upper."</p><p>Mayer's big mouth struck again big time while <a href=#>dating Jessica Simpson</a>, who he infamously told <a href=#>Playboy</a>&nbsp;is "like crack cocaine to me," calling her "sexual napalm." Whoa dude! At least <a href=#>he regrets</a> saying it.</p><p>Brief relationships followed with Cameron Diaz, Minka Kelly, and Jennifer Aniston, but perhaps the most infamous of <a href=#>Mayer's past girlfriends is Taylor Swift</a>, who may or may not have written her 2010 song "Dear John" about him. Per <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a>, Mayer was "humiliated" by <a href=#>the song</a>, in which Swift sang that she was "too young to be messed with" (she was 19 to his 32), but she has never said officially who the song is about.</p><p>Mayer's longest and most recent relationship was with Katy Perry, who he dated from 2012 to 2014, and again in 2015, before she found love with Orlando Bloom. His 2017 song <a href=#>"Still Feel Like Your Man"</a> is "pretty plainly" about Perry, according to&nbsp;<a href=#>The New York Times</a>. He told the Times, "Who else would I be thinking about?" Hopefully, the Casanova will find love again now that he's older... and hopefully more discreet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbG1laH94e9ahpmaZopp6q7vHp2Smmamav7R5xZqkqK2jYrK5ecaiqaWeop6yr7DSaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./where-is-the-cabin-filter-on-a-2011-silverado-html.html><span>←</span><span>Where is the cabin filter on a 2011 Silverado?</span></a>
