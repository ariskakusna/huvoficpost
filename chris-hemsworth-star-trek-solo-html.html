Hemsworth originally played George Kirk at the beginning of 2009’s&nbsp;Star Trek&nbsp;— his first credited movie role. In the movie, Hemsworth was seen captaining a starship in a battle against the film’s time-traveling antagonist, ultimately sacrificing himself to save his wife and his unborn son. In an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTuber Josh Horowitz</a>, however, the plan didn’t come to fruition for several reasons.</p><p>Horowitz revealed that he had seen a proposed script for Chris Hemsworth’s return to&nbsp;Star Trek. He described it as seeming like a father-son buddy movie. Captain James T. Kirk, played by Chris Pine, would travel to the past and reunite with his late father.&nbsp;</p><p>Chris Hemsworth revealed that he would have enjoyed returning to the role, but that everyone involved got too busy to make it happen. Now, he believes it will never happen. It has been 13 years since the first film was released, and Hemsworth noted that it would seem strange for his character to look so much older than he did when he died.</p><p>The death of Chris Hemsworth’s version of George Kirk might have been a brief scene, but it had lasting repercussions on the reboot series’ lore. His death changed the course of history in the new&nbsp;Star Trek&nbsp;canon, causing James T. Kirk to grow up without a father and completely altering the course of events in the series’ universe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/chris-hemsworth-star-trek-900x449.jpeg><p>While there currently are plans to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">create a fourth film</a>&nbsp;in this universe, there are doubts about whether it will actually be made.&nbsp;Oddly, the possible return of George Kirk was not the only character resurrection that Chris Hemsworth discussed during the interview. He spoke about his return to the role of Tyler Rake in the upcoming&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Extraction 2</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>At the end of the original 2020 film, Chris Hemsworth’s character died. He said that, originally, the plan was to end the series there. But, as is often the case, popular movies result in sequels.</p><p>“Too many people watched it, so we brought him back,” Christ Hemsworth said, laughing. “We were so proud of it. We were like, no, we’re killing him. We’re killing the character, and that’s it. And then they’re like, ‘There might be a sequel, though.'”</p><p>While George Kirk was the first movie role that Chris Hemsworth played, it was not his first acting role. From 2004 until 2007, Hemsworth played the role of Kim Hyde in the long-lived Australian soap opera&nbsp;Home and Away. Before landing that part, he played multiple smaller roles. He appeared as King Arthur for two episodes of the fantasy series&nbsp;Guinevere Jones, and appeared in individual episodes of&nbsp;Neighbors,&nbsp;Marshall Law,&nbsp;The Saddle Club,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Fergus McPhail.</p><p>Although Chris Hemsworth will likely never return to the set of&nbsp;Star Trek, and he has&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">expressed doubts</a>&nbsp;about continuing his role as Thor, his career has been more than successful. Along with the upcoming&nbsp;Avengers: Secret Wars, Hemsworth is set to appear in the upcoming&nbsp;Furiosa, Extraction 2,&nbsp;and an as-yet-unnamed Hulk Hogan biopic.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2ibmKe2tHnHnqSsr5%2Bnwal50q2Yq2Wkp7KsedKoo6hmmKm6rQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1569191-chapter-32-nancy-isime-channels-kid-beautiful-photos-video-marks-birthday.html><span>←</span><span>Chapter 32: Nancy Isime Channels Inner Child in Beautiful Photos, Video As She Marks Birthday</span></a>
