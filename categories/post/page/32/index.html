This change meant a switch from weekly to quarterly releases, with the manga now appearing only four times a year. While this has led to a hiatus and longer waits between chapters, the anticipation for chapter 369 is high, promising to bring new excitement and developments to the series.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Blackpink's Jisoo Is the New Face of Alo Yoga</h2><time>Aug 26, 2024</time>
