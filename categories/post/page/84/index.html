<a href=../../../../can-brake-lines-be-spliced-html.html></a>

Answer Contrary to common perception it is NOT unlawful to create a new portion of brake line and splice it into a non-rusted part of your old brake, as long as you use automotive grade SAE double/inverted flare, SAE “bubble” flare and DIN Single Mushroom flare unions and fittings.
Consequently, are brake line compression fittings legal? Compression fittings may splice portions or sections of steel brake line together to establish a seal between the two parts.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../../categories/post/page/83/>← Prev Page</a>
