UPDATE, Sept. 20, 2021: Following the publication of this article, 200 Cigarettes was re-released and is now available for purchase on Amazon. You're welcome. I'm sorry, but you can't have my copy of 200 Cigarettes. It isn't personal. In fact, one of my best friends once offered to buy it from me, and I told her the same thing that I am telling you : Absolutely not, get out of my apartment.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>WWE Finally Reveals Seating Chart for Next Years Royal Rumble</h2><time>Aug 10, 2024</time>

Forget the bride and groom (or the two brides or two grooms), weddings can be more stressful for the guests—especially when you have no idea what to get the couple who has&nbsp;everything.
