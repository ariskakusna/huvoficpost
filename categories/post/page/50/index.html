The answer is that regular water changes are important for the long-term health of your fish. The dissolved wastes in the water, which are not apparent to the naked eye, won't kill the fish outright, but as wastes gradually accumulate the stress reduces their immunity to disease.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Etta James obituary | Etta James</h2><time>Aug 23, 2024</time>
