Accommodation
Set in the middle of private forested parkland in north-east Scotland, this Victorian castle – an exclusive-use venue – is one of Scotland's grandest and most historically significant houses.
In the 19th century it was the family home of the four-time British Prime MinisterWilliam Gladstone, and was considered the most sophisticated building in the country at the time. Now Fasque, a dramatic sandstone building in the style of a castle with spectacular public rooms and 19 lavishly furnished bedrooms, is synonymous with grandeur, luxurious interior design and complete privacy.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Fiddler's Cove Beach &amp;amp; Racquet Club</h2><time>Aug 4, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../../good-behavior-review-944700.html></a>
TNT‘s latest drama, Good Behavior, has more than a few good things going for it — starting with a beautifully moody and exceptionally rendered pilot by director Charlotte Sieling (Homeland, The Americans, Queen of the South), a virtuoso performance from Michelle Dockery (Downton Abbey) and the kind of intriguing loose ends that keep you wanting to come back.
The downside is not knowing, after the three episodes TNT made available for review, whether Good Behavior can sustain a believable key relationship to anchor the series, especially when the third episode’s dramatic tension revolves mostly around whether a Tesla will be able to sustain a charge long enough to get to a power station.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Iman pays tribute to David Bowie on their 24th wedding anniversary</h2><time>Aug 4, 2024</time>
