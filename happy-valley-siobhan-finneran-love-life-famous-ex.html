The Happy Valley star was married to Heartbeat and Emmerdale actor Mark Jordaon whom she met in the 1990s. The pair tied the knot in August 1997 and soon <strong>welcomed two children together, a daughter named Poppy and a son named, Jordan.</strong></p><p id=exUknI2_qOX- data-wc=37>It's been reported that Siobhan took a step back from acting in order to raise the children. However, <strong>in 2014, the pair divorced and Mark later remarried</strong> and welcomed two children with his second wife, Laura Norton.</p><p id=eSM9n8OSn1Hl data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Happy Valley viewers convinced they've worked out major plot twist ahead of final episode</a></strong></p><p id=eMco-oNlTz0x data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Happy Valley: 5 theories on how the gritty show will end</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c80aaae5d859-mark-jordon-z.jpg><p id=eZ8josjhpgSn data-wc=9><strong>Siobhan was previously married to Heartbeat actor Mark Jordon</strong></p><h2>Is Siobhan Finneran related to Sarah Lancashire?</h2><p id=ecIQk0zW-BRW data-wc=43>Due to Siobhan and Sarah's brilliant on-screen chemistry as the Cawood sisters, many seem to be convinced that the pair of stars are related. Although there's no familial tie there, the actors go way back and seem to have a very close bond.</p><p id=eOPkDcoNpVyB data-wc=48><strong>Recalling when she first met Sarah when Siobhan was just 17 years old,</strong> the Clare actress said: "She's a couple of years older and was doing this brilliant theatre studies course at Oldham College, which I'd applied to. Sarah and some other students performed at the open day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/27fa04d47db0-clare-and-catherine-in-happy-valley-z.jpg><p id=e4mojpFbSjib data-wc=12><strong>Siobhan Finneran and Sarah Lancashire as the Cawood sisters in Happy Valley</strong></p><p id=eWNwuajZ4ba3 data-wc=37>"We met then and eventually did a play together. We've both got a slightly warped sense of humour and we both like a cake. It's always a joy to work with another actress who actually eats cake."</p><h2>What else is there to know about Siobhan Finneran?</h2><p id=eu0VePKwwjDo data-wc=40>Similar to Sarah, Siobhan has enjoyed plenty of success in her acting career. She's perhaps best known for appearing in Clocking Off, Benidorm, Downton Abbey and the feature film, Rita, Sue and Bob, Too, which was her big screen debut.&nbsp;</p><p id=ePCQJMOnvuNQ data-wc=15><strong>Like this story?<a class=hm-link href=#> Sign up to our What to Watch newsletter</a> and get the heads-up on the shows and films everyone’s talking about.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5rZ2trYGaAcX2VbGdwaV%2BdrrG82GatmqScmsZuv8iomaGZnmKzqrrNnqmapl2hvLexjKWgn51dm66uu9SsZJ6wXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./george-clooney-opens-up-parenting-twins-denies-using-fertility-drugs-1034974.html><span>←</span><span>George Clooney Opens Up About Parenting Twins, Denies Using Fertility Drugs</span></a>
