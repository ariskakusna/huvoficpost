And from the opening twenty seconds of <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Hopsin</a>'s latest single "Happy Ending," you can already tell that it's going to be a strange ride. As you might have guessed from the title and album artwork, "Happy Ending" finds Hop putting on a masterclass in storytelling about his experience getting an "Asian massage."And while it does have a few laughs, it might be hard to get past the cringeworthy Asian impression Hop puts on in the chorus: "I can give you good massage, I can be your everything, you give me fifty bucks, If you know say nothing, I can give you sucky-sucky, If you give me more money, I give you do something lucky." Now that you have a better idea of what to expect, let's dive in.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">There are some heavy <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>R. Kelly</a> vibes on this one, circa "Trapped In The Closet," evident in both Hop's melodic delivery and the absurdity of the subject matter. The track is truly a narrative about Hopsin's experience getting an Asian massage, which plays out in X-rated detail, complete with voice acting and (for better or worse) extremely detailed imagery. At times, the track has some strong moments of humor, but one wonders what might have gone through his head while recording some of these lines.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Perhaps he simply had to celebrate the glories of Asian massage parlors and the&nbsp;lovely ladies who operate them. Regardless of motive, "Happy Ending" is a bizarre direction for Hopsin, but one that's not entirely devoid of charm, if you can get past the more ridiculous elements. Overall, though, it's lighthearted and does manage to capture some of what made "Trapped In The Closet" so memorable.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span><strong>Quotable Lyrics</strong></span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Lowkey I was feeling kinda awkward<br>She jacked me off and gave me my top first<br>I stayed quiet as I watched her<br>My dick had a strong posture<br>She said, “You very big like a monster”</p><p>About The Author</p><p>&lt;b>Feature Editor&lt;/b> &lt;!--BR--> Mitch Findlay is a writer and hip-hop journalist based in Montreal.
