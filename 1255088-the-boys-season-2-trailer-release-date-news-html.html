The Boys are the rivals of The Seven. The two rival teams face each other as The Boys attempt to control the corrupt members of The Seven. The series premiered on the 26th of July 2019. Even before the premiere of this season, <i>The Boys </i>Season 2 had already been approved for filming.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4021b5a59ab696ef.jpg><p class=align-left>The first season of <i>The Boys</i> had intense and relevant themes that pleased the audience. <i>The Boys</i> Season 2 is a continuation of the first season. It is a fantastic superhero series that <a href=# title rel="nofollow noopener">Eric Kripke developed</a> for Amazon Prime Video. It is based on the comic book series, which are written by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson.</p><h2>What happens before The Boys Season 2</h2><p class=align-left>The Boys episodes in the first season ended with critical revelations and unexpected twists. Although fans were aware of the rivalry between Billy and Homelander, the final episodes in the first season reveal that Billy abhors superheroes. He particularly loathes Homelander because he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">raped his wife, Becca</a>, who was formerly working for Vought. In the finale, Becca is alive and is a mother to the child she conceived from the rape ordeal. Billy is broken when he realises that his wife is raising a child whose biological father is his arch-nemesis.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d81de84814892a31.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>All you need to know about Love Island USA 2020: Cast, couples, end and start date</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d81de84814892a31.jpg><p class=align-left>In the first season of <i>The Boys</i> series, superheroes discover that they can procreate with human beings, contrary to what Vought said. What happens after this revelation? On the other hand, The Seven have been knocked out, but they are not out of the game. The Boys are on the run because they do not want to be caught by the powerful organisation.</p><h3>The Boys Season 2 questions</h3><p class=align-left>The second season of Amazon Prime <i>The Boys</i> will be epic following the explosive end that was observed in the first season. The new episodes were <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">approved for filming</a> one week before the official premiere of the first eight episodes. Billy is still angry and emotional after finding out that his wife Becca is alive, and is the mother of his enemy's biological child. He is livid because Homelander raped his beloved wife. Will he get himself together in this season, and what will become of his relationship with Becca? The Seven are in deep trouble after their number declined. Will new members join the team?</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9d32067881c624ea.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Interesting details about Tiger King Netflix characters: Where are they now?</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7e8bbf68c5dc4861.jpg><h2>Season 2 The Boys Amazon Prime release</h2><p class=align-left>The official date of release of Season&nbsp;2 is yet to be announced.
