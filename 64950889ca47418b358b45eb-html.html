The altercation occurred when the brother allegedly brandished a<strong> handgun</strong> and<strong> threatened </strong>Ariza, prompting him to take immediate legal action.</p><p>The incident adds another layer of complexity to the ongoing <strong>divorce battle </strong>between <strong>Trevor Ariza</strong> and his ex-wife, <strong>Bree Anderson</strong>. Their marriage, which lasted four years, came to an end in 2022, and since then, the couple has been entangled in a bitter dispute over <strong>custody and financial support</strong> for their two minor children.</p><p>Earlier this month, <strong>Bree Anderson </strong>demanded exclusive use of their shared <strong>San Diego home</strong> as part of the divorce proceedings. However, <strong>Trevor Ariza</strong> has vehemently opposed this request, claiming that the property is a major point of contention in their divorce and accusing Bree of attempting to block his access by <strong>falsely </strong>claiming ownership.</p><p><strong>Ariza</strong> has argued that neither of them resides at the San Diego home on a full-time basis, pointing out that <strong>Bree</strong> lives in a separate residence in <strong>Playa Vista, California,</strong> which he financially supports. This assertion strengthens Ariza's position that exclusive use of the <strong>San Diego property </strong>should not be granted to his ex-wife.</p><p>The recent incident took place on June 6, 2023, when<strong> Trevor Ariza</strong> visited the San Diego home during a time when he believed it would be vacant. As he entered the house, he was confronted by Bree's brother, <strong>Donald,</strong> who aggressively approached him while wielding a handgun. Donald demanded that Ariza leave the premises, <strong>threatening him with bodily harm </strong>if he refused.</p><p>Ariza, understandably<strong> terrified</strong>, tried to reason with Donald, emphasizing that the house belonged to him. Despite his efforts to de-escalate the situation, Ariza was forced to gather his belongings and leave under the<strong> threat of violence.</strong> The<strong> ex-NBA star </strong>described his fear of leaving his children behind and his concern for his <strong>grieving mother</strong>, who had just buried her father the week before.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>Ariza's Swift action leads to arrest and legal protections, divorce battle takes a tumultuous turn</h2><p>Following the alarming incident, <strong>Trevor Ariza</strong> promptly contacted the authorities, leading to Donald's immediate arrest. Ariza was issued an<strong> Emergency Protective Order </strong>and subsequently granted a <strong>Temporary Restraining Order (TRO)</strong> to safeguard himself and his children from any further harm.</p><p>Ariza later discovered that <strong>Donald had claimed</strong> Bree had sent him to the house, and he further learned that Bree had been allowing her family members to reside there without his knowledge or consent. These revelations strengthen Ariza's argument <strong>against granting exclusive use of the San Diego home </strong>to his ex-wife and highlight the need for better communication and notice regarding access to the property.</p><p>In addition to his demands regarding the San Diego home, Ariza insists that third parties <strong>should not have access to the property </strong>without the presence and permission of the party granting access. These stipulations aim to protect the privacy and security of both<strong> himself and his children</strong> during this challenging period.</p><p>As Trevor Ariza's <strong>divorce battle</strong> with Bree Anderson continues to intensify, the recent incident involving her brother and the subsequent restraining order serve as reminders of the high stakes involved in their ongoing legal proceedings. The court's decision regarding exclusive use of the <strong>San Diego home</strong> and the custody arrangement for their children will undoubtedly have a profound impact on the future of this former <strong>NBA </strong>star and his family.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jpuYrKOVqa%2BiuMtopZuZX6G8tHnAp56epJWoeq2typ6prGdiZX90e49vZmtrX2uBeoGPcW9ym5FphHV9l5tqbnCSaYKmro2hq6ak</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./etta-james.html><span>←</span><span>Etta James obituary | Etta James</span></a>
