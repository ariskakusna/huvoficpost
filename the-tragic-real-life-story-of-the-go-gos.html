In other words, Schock believed that she was owed royalty payments and that Caffey sat on them. In the suit, the drummer alleged, among other crimes, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and fraud. Seeking $100,000, the suit was quietly settled, and according to the <a href=#>Seattle Times</a>, Schock and Caffey signed an agreement to not discuss the case any further.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2Bk25qbXFfqbWmedOrmKChk2K%2Fpq3LZqOinpViwLW70bJkqJ5dqbWmecaoZKCno2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./700498-sza-bikini-photo-dump-instagram.html><span>←</span><span>SZA Makes Jaws Drop With Her Latest Bikini-Clad Photo Dump On Instagram</span></a>
