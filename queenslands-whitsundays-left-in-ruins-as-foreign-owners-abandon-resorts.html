Locals were also evicted from the island.</p><p>Ms Camm is calling for a state parliamentary inquiry into the management of all Queensland islands.</p><p>“There is no doubt in my mind that the Queensland state government has lost control when it comes to island management,” she told <i>A Current Affair</i>.</p><p>“It’s not just this island but there’s other islands as well.”</p><p>Queensland Tourism Industry Council chief executive Daniel Gschwind told the program the sight of the resorts set a “bad reputation” for tourism investments.</p><p>“We have to remember that they’re very precious assets in sometimes very precious environments,” he said.</p><p>“So if they don’t deliver what they promise, then certainly, we should see how it can be resolved and how their community can get some benefit out of these.”</p><span class=title>Read related topics:</span><a class=topic_tag href=# data-tgev-container=story-topic-links data-tgev-label=Brisbane data-tgev-order=1 data-tgev-metric=npv data-tgev=event10>Brisbane</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ706uYr52cZMGzrdWeo2atoJmutbHSaKiunZWjwK2tzZ2qZq%2BYnsG0wc2dmLKrXaGyp8CMoqVmqqWeu7R5wKxkn6eimraouoyorqedoqh6oq7Ap5uopl2nsrS70a2qaKaVrMBuv9OoqbJnZ5qBo4GXnZlymWJpsad9kZpunJxjabOmspNyZ2ptlGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./oblu-select-at-sangeli-hotel.html><span>←</span><span>Oblu Select at Sangeli Hotel Review, North Male Atoll, The Maldives</span></a>
