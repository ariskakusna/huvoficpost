"She just doesn’t want anything to do with me," he said. "And I can't blame her." He also spoke about his ex-wife <strong>Elaine Irwin</strong>, and revealed that the pair are still close. He said: "I was married to Elaine for 20 years. Elaine and I are still good friends… Other than Elaine, of all the girls, [Meg] was fantastic."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9708bec64b31-meg-ryan-a.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eHr1nmPnJveO data-wc=6><strong>Meg split from John in 2015</strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!

In an interview with magazine, she said: "He's world class. There's not one speck of music that's not his. He's got some kind of magic touch." The star was also previously married to Dennis Quaid for ten years before they divorced in 2001, and has publicly revealed that the actor was unfaithful to her during their marriage. Addressing her affair with <a class=hm-link href=#>Russell Crowe </a>back in 2000, she told : "It was a great story. But what wasn't in the story was the reality of my marriage. Dennis was not faithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful. I think when things get played out that simply in black-and-white, it makes people feel good… The tabloid culture can't tell a complicated story."<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8c3yQcGdsaGJohHGAlWihqKCeYrqmuMuepZyZnaV6sLqMoaCsZaKauaLAyKilrKCZpXq4tdOhZKadl2K%2Fuq3NaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-it-healthy-to-eat-a-cockroach.html><span>←</span><span>Is it healthy to eat a cockroach?</span></a>
