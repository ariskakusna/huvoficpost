Each member famously has a partnership with a major fashion label and brands ranging from hair dye and makeup to athleisure —&nbsp;and the latest team-up sees Jisoo (full name Kim Jisoo) partnering with Alo Yoga, which is already a celeb favorite thanks to&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kendall Jenner and Hailey Bieber</a>.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy Alo Yoga</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jisoo fronts Alo's Spring 2024 collection and is set to continue working with the brand throughout the year. It's the perfect way to inject some K-pop cool into any workout 'fit, and with Jisoo's stamp of approval, it looks like fans are going to go crazy for the latest drops from the brand.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy Alo Yoga</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“This partnership with Alo felt like the perfect match because my health and wellness have always been a priority for me. I love to move whenever I have the time, especially with yoga [and] Pilates," Jisoo said in a statement accompanying the news. Her first campaign features the superstar in a white puffer coat — one of Alo Yoga's most popular pieces — as well as a pink (and black, get it?) matching set and a chunky sneaker.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy Alo Yoga</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Alo Yoga may have its roots in Los Angeles, but the brand has expanded to include 81 locations (ahem,&nbsp;sanctuaries) across the world. With the Jisoo partnership, the brand hopes to spread its message of "style, wellness, and mindful movement" to fans everywhere.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy Alo Yoga</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Alo is just the latest in a long list of Jisoo's partnerships. Late last year, she announced that she would take on the role of&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>global ambassador for Dyson</a>. Prior to that, she became a Cartier brand ambassador in 2022 and has been a Dior ambassador since 2019. She has starred in campaigns for the storied French label's cosmetics, perfume, accessories, and more.<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy Alo Yoga</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But, of course, she's a musician and actress first and foremost. In 2023, she released a solo single, "Flower," that made it to no. 2 on&nbsp;Billboard's Global 200 and topped the charts in South Korea, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Vietnam. She was the last member of Blackpink to release solo material and went on to earn 100 million streams on Spotify in just 32 days, breaking a record previously held by her bandmate Lisa (Lalisa Manobal). She would go on to perform the song at Blackpink's Coachella sets in 2023, as well as the Tokyo Dome stop of the band's Born Pink World Tour.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57waWYnKOgnrusecmiqqinXZa5sHnYqJ6aZZOWurGtyKClZnBkZ4J0gpA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./black-clover-369-release-date-time-plot-where-to-watch.html><span>←</span><span>Black Clover 369 Release Date, Time, Plot &amp;amp; Where to Watch?</span></a>
