Riding took a big toll on my body, I’ve had a lot of broken bones, I’ve got a lot of scars and scars from surgeries – it’s a crazy sport definitely.”</p><p><b>RELATED: <a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=792279fbbc59da81b237104774c5d876 data-tgev-label=finance data-tgev-metric=ev>Aussie turns $4 item into $2 million empire</a></b></p><p>A name change for the business came in 2018 with it being rebranded to LSKD, with a keener focus on functional sportswear with a street wear aesthetic, said Mr Daniel, who loves to wear a pair of the brand’s shorts to the office.</p><p>“I love wearing sportswear that you can wear every day with a street wear look, where you could literally change shoes in the office and go for a run or go to gym,” he said. “It’s for the everyday athelete, who can also wear the product to the office.”</p><p>LSKD’s range includes sports, fitness, and adventure apparel, with product development sometimes taking up to 12 months. It is based on everything from consumer feedback, with Mr Daniel describing the business as “customer obsessed”, to ensuring the fabric fit and feel is perfect, as well as testing different sizes in a range of training sessions.</p><p>“We are not fast fashion. We are not trying to rush products and get them out tomorrow and we need them in two to three weeks,” he explained. “We are trying to focus on product that will last a long time, so it is longer process.”</p><p>The Queenslander decided to move away from wholesale, with LSKD shutting that side of the business down last year, as well as discontinuing items like life jackets and gloves.</p><p>Instead it decided to sell direct to consumers online, alongside its two stores in the US and Australia. This move saw the brand’s revenue climb from $3.3 million to $9 million last financial year. This year, LSKD’s revenue is set to skyrocket to $50 million by the end of the year, according to Mr Daniel.</p><p>But the 34-year-old said the journey to create a successful activewear brand has not been easy.</p><p>“It wasn’t an overnight success. We faced roadblocks every step of the way, from selling into a retailer, being told by some I couldn’t do it, learning how to leverage the internet, to saying no and giving ourselves a fresh start with a new name in 2018. It was 14 years of trial and error,” he said.</p><p><b>RELATED: <a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=23b378dcf59b10eddb4c9deec59a43ca data-tgev-label=finance data-tgev-metric=ev>Couple make $1 million from Friday night in</a></b></p><p>A bestseller is their Rep Tights, which retail for $80 and are described as pairing the fit and features of active tights with soft, smooth fabric and styling for a “casual, street-inspired” look.</p><p>“Our Rep tights are one of the really key products of our brand. There are 1680 five star reviews online,” Mr Daniel said. “We wanted to get a buttery soft fabric that people could train in with a high intensity workout, but where when they are not working out, it gives a functional, street vibe and it resonates with them.”</p><p>Also on the bestselling list are LSKD’s women’s competition shorts that are made from recycled polyester and cost $65 and the shape pullover hoodie, which are sold for $80.</p><p>LSKD’s even got the celebrity seal of approval with Zac Efron recently spotted wearing the brand.</p><p>Its puffer jackets, sold for $210, have also been popular and have recently undergo a redesign, with a sustainability focus.</p><p>“We redeveloped the outer shell of the puffer jacket and it’s now made from recycled materials like fishing nets and camping equipment that has washed up to shore and been found. We break it down and use the offcuts and leftovers to make the nylon outer shell for the jacket,” he said.</p><p>“Making a puffer jacket that is made entirely from recycled materials is a long-term goal. The fashion industry is definitely not perfect and we are learning that as we grow as a brand, especially with our fast growth. It’s probably going to be one of our top bestsellers. It’s got thermal 3D installation, it’s feather free, and making the internal side from recycled materials is the next step.”</p><p>Next up for LSKD is seamless sportswear, which is arriving in June, alongside Australian-made tights in the next six months.</p><span class=title>Read related topics:</span><a class=topic_tag href=# data-tgev-container=story-topic-links data-tgev-label=Brisbane data-tgev-order=1 data-tgev-metric=npv data-tgev=event10>Brisbane</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xaKlmqaTmny0ucClo2aapai2r7HSrGaqrZWau7S4wKebZpmTqba3sdaemKtlkqeur7CMpaqknF2ku27A0ZqapGWkpHqurcqeZG5oXaK2rbjIqKVoppWswG6%2F06ipsmdiZbOigcBramudkpmGo4OWcGpxb2SZsKaylppwmnFnZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nfl-bills-damien-harris-suffers-neck-injury-all-details-mid-game-hospital-update.html><span>←</span><span>NFL: Bills star Damien Harris suffers neck injury - all we know following terrifying mid game hospit</span></a>
