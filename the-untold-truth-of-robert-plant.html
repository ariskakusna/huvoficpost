He spent his teenage years living close to Stourbridge, and his father would take him to the town's blues club, Seven Stars (via <a href=#>The Guardian</a>). That's where Plant would cut his teeth with house band, the <a href=#>Delta Blues Band</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>But the more time he spent at the blues bar, the less time he would spend at school. Needless to say, this behavior started a conflict within his family, as Plant's parents were afraid he would give up a solid career for a wild goose chase.&nbsp;As he confessed to The Guardian, "I was at school at the time, and it was really hard to combine the two and keep a compatible relationship with schoolmasters and parents at the same time as doing what I really wanted to do."&nbsp;When he joined a band called the Crawling King Snakes, this deeply upset his parents, and their relationship grew cold for a while.</p><p dir=ltr>While Plant managed to scrape by with barely passing grades for his final exams, as the story goes, <a href=#>he was allegedly expelled</a> due to truancy. So, at 17, Plant left home. But as he told <a href=#>Louder</a>, "Well, I was bound for a proper job, and I've got one...&nbsp;I made my peace with my parents a couple of years later."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCFj21tcGxfqbWmedSnq6iklGLBs8HToWSonl2nvKOx0a1kqaSRo8Fw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-new-yorker-s-bert-ernie-cover-is-fantastic-even-if-they-re-not-actually-gay.html><span>←</span><span>The New Yorkers Bert &amp;amp; Ernie Cover Is Fantastic (Even If Theyre Not Actually Gay)</span></a>
