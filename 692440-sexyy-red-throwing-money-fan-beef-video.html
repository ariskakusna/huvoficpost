Interestingly, artists who are actually do this for a living have become increasingly afraid to step out on stage. This is due to a sudden trend of fans throwing random objects at performers. One of the most brutal instances we've seen was Bebe Rexha being <a href=# rel>hit in the face</a> with a phone. At the time, her assailant apparently thought it would make a funny joke. More recently, it was <a href=# class=text-word rel>Sexyy Red</a> who was left offended by her unexpected gift.</p><p>In a video making rounds online, the Hood Hottest Princess takes the stage in Detroit at Wild Mustang Gentleman's Club.

While giving it her all at Summer Smash at the end of June, the salacious songwriter <a href=# rel>walked off</a> as the crowd continued to toss random objects in her direction.</p><p>Over-eager audience members aren't the only ones who have been getting under Sexyy Red's skin lately. This past weekend, it was Tasha K's nasty comments about the rising star that got the internet talking, though they've since <a href=# rel>worked things out</a>.
