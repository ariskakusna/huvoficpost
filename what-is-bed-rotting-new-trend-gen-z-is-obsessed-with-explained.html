My bed, hotel bed, beach sand, hammock etc. I was made to lay and rot.”</p><p>Another described the trend as their “passion” and “hobby”.</p><p>“Me watching this while laying in bed everyday for the past two weeks Never felt so alive,” another wrote.</p><p>Some even take it to the next level and get ready for a day in bed with a makeup and outfit routine.</p><p>It follows the “everything shower” trend on social media, meaning a shower routine that can last hours with countless products and music playing.</p><p>One influencer said: “An everything shower with hot water and Taylor Swift is better than sex. Sorry.”</p><p>In a TikTok video, she described her routine: “I wash my hair, shave my legs, shave my armpits, deep condition, exfoliate, do my skincare. I do everything in the shower.”</p><p>Her “everything shower” only takes place once a month, but many do it more often.</p><p>Dermatologist Dr Lindsey Zubritsky explained that there was a right way to do an “everything shower”, and it has to do with the order of your routine.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>She recommends starting with washing your hair because if you wait too long to rinse out your conditioner, it can sit on your skin and cause back acne.</p><p>Next you should exfoliate, before shaving with gel to lower your risk of irritation.
