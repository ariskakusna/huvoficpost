Veteran actor Sir Ian McKellen admits he has already prepared his memorial service.
The Lord of the Rings and X-Men star turned 76 last month and is acutely aware of his mortality because he has seen many friends die in recent years.
McKellen says he decided to put preparations in place for his death by drawing up a running order for his memorial service, which he hopes will take place in a large theatre."><meta name=author content="Tandra Barner"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
