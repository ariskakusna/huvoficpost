After facing several delays, the game’s release date has now been confirmed for June 29. This game will mark the first time many wrestlers on the AEW roster will be featured as playable characters in a video game.</p><p>Brock Lesnar is quite familiar with being immortalized in video games. However, in AEW Fight Forever, he will have a unique presence. In a footage previewing the game’s finisher creation suite, players can select Lesnar’s iconic F5 finishing move.</p><p>To leave no doubt about the reference to Brock Lesnar, the move is aptly named ‘Diverticulitis’ in the game. This is a nod to Lesnar’s real-life battle with diverticulitis, which forced him to retire from UFC in 2011. Of course, the move might have also garnered that name because it wrecks an opponent’s guts.</p><p>We will have to see how everything pans out in this situation, because you never know what else fans will find in the new video game.
