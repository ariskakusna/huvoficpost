She shared a clip from the special moment on her Instagram with the caption, "THANK YOU TO THESE BEAUTIFUL DRAG QUEENS FOR SHOWING THEIR PRIDE IN TENNESSEE ‚ô•Ô∏èüß°üíõüíöüíôüíúü©µü§é."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a separate video, also shared to Instagram, Lizzo explained to the Knoxville audience why she was still adamant about performing in the state after people encouraged her to cancel her show.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">‚ÄúBut why would I not come to the people who need to hear this message the most, the people who need to feel this release the most?‚Äù&nbsp;she asked the cheering crowd. ‚ÄúWhy would I not create a safe space in Tennessee where we can celebrate drag entertainers and celebrate our differences and celebrate fat Black women?‚Äù</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>CNN</a>, Tennessee Governor Bill Lee&nbsp;signed legislation that banned "adult cabaret" in public or around children, including ‚Äúmale or female impersonators,‚Äù which many have interpreted as drag queens.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a separate post, Lizzo shared two photos with the complete group of performers. In the first slide, the queens posed next to the artist and avid flutist. A second snap showed Lizzo with the RuPaul contestants as well as Acquaria, who stars in the the Las Vegas Drag Race Live show.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I WANNA TAKE THE TIME AND THANK EACH & EVERY ONE OF THESE INCREDIBLE ENTERTAINERS," she wrote next to the images.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lizzo has long been known for being inclusive, a spokesperson of body positivity, and an ally to the LGBTQ+ community. The rapper and singer even created an Emmy-winning competition show called Lizzo's Watch Out for the Big Grrrls that gives plus-size dancers a shot at booking a spot in her performance troupe for her world tour.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57y6Kxs6ddpb%2BwwMSsq56cXamyr7rErKqenV2Zv6KzjJuYp2WhqrKmutJmoqenqKu2rbjEZqqhp6dihHWEk21rbQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1595731-little-boy-sheds-tears-watching-aunt-cry-hard-console-video-people-react.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Little Boy Sheds Tears While Watching His Aunt Cry, Tries Hard to Console Her in Video, People React</span></a>
