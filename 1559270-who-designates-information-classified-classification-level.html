This step is vital in safeguarding sensitive data of a country or an organisation. Designating the information that should be classified and determining to what extent to classify it is governed by established laws and guidelines.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a73ac785b75d54e3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Australia ports firm fights to restore operations after cyber incident</span></p></a><h3>Who is responsible for classifying information?</h3><p class=align-left>The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">data owner</a> is responsible for categorising it. The owner could be a government, an organisation, or an individual.</p><p class=align-left>Governments and institutions have a body known as the classification authority responsible for designating classified information. They also decide the classification levels each piece of information falls into. In the United States, for example, the <a id=https://sgp.fas.org/othergov/intel/odni-80-16-3.pdf href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Original Classification Authority</a> (OCA) has the mandate of categorising national security material.</p><h3>Levels of classified information</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a73ac785b75d54e3.jpg><p class=align-left>Data classification is vital in protecting information and creating cyber awareness of sensitive data. There are different levels of classifying data, each indicating the level of sensitivity. The main ones are top secret, secret, and confidential. Below are levels of classification of information.</p><h4>1. Top Secret</h4><p class=align-left>This category is the highest level of information classification. Information is classified as "Top Secret" if it could severely harm the country's interests. Examples include information about the design of nuclear weapons, specifics of intelligence satellite capabilities, and the identities of undercover operatives.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b73886340fee65af.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Corporations fall short on implementing green agendas: report</span></p></a><h4>2. Secret</h4><p class=align-left>Information is classified as secret if it could result in significant harm to the interests of the country or organisation. It is protected against <a id=https://www.legit.ng/ask-legit/guides/1121562-how-first-bank-internet-banking-token/ href=#>unauthorised access</a>. A few examples include:</p><ul><li>Sensitive diplomatic correspondence.</li><li>The development of cutting-edge weaponry.</li><li>Comprehensive knowledge of intelligence sources and techniques.</li></ul><h4>3. Confidential</h4><p class=align-left>Information is classified as confidential if it could jeopardise <a href=#>national security</a> if made public. Examples of confidential information include locations of military outposts, active military operations, and the identities of intelligence operatives.</p><h4>4. Sensitive But Unclassified</h4><p class=align-left>The information in this category is not classified for reasons of national security. It is information that requires administrative supervision and protection against unauthorised disclosure. Examples include attorney-client privileged information, export-controlled information (ITAR, EAR), and IT security information.</p><h4>5. Official</h4><p class=align-left>The designation is applied to information meant only for official use and needs protection even though it is not classified. It contains details that, if made public, could endanger people.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1b340286c4f4b693.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>No more 90-day trial: New Zealand updates work visa to allow construction workers, IT, others</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Official is a level restriction comparable to the US Department of Defense's classification <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">For Official Use Only</a> (FOUO). The content contains a range of data with different levels of sensitivity and loss or compromise effects.</p><h4>6. Unclassified</h4><p class=align-left>The word "unclassified" refers to data that was previously thought to be sensitive, but now it's not. Due to its sensitivity, unclassified information is neither classified nor needs special security measures. However, it must still be handled carefully and discreetly.</p><h4>7. Clearance</h4><p class=align-left>Clearance is a generic classification based on a need-to-know criterion. You must present the required documents and a valid need-to-know reason to access material at this level.</p><h4>8. Compartmented information</h4><p class=align-left>Information that has been compartmentalised has been given distinct departmental keywords. It's a comprehensive risk-based level for protecting official intelligence sources.</p><h3>Colour coding of classified documents</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b5e1ef45edc6cb68.jpg><p class=align-left>Colour coding makes it simple to recognise classified information.
