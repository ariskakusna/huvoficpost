He played a memorable role as Mr. Duvall in the 2004 film "Mean Girls," written by Tina Fey. He also had a big role in "Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping"&nbsp;as the manager to Andy Samberg's fictional musician character Conner. In the third season of "I Think You Should Leave," a series that stars and was co-created by "SNL" alum Tim Robinson, Meadows had a memorable role as a dad posing for a group photo at his daughter's wedding.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>The list goes on. Meadows has even admitted it's hard sometimes to remember all of his guest spots. "There'll be times when I'll be watching something — for instance, I had 'Reba' on the TV while I was doing stuff around the house. As I was listening, I was going, 'Man, everything they're saying sounds so familiar.' And then I was like, 'Oh, I'm on this episode,'" he told&nbsp;<a href=#>The Pitch</a>.</p><p>In 2023, Meadows performed stand-up at Jimmy Kimmel's Comedy Club in Las Vegas. This was during the actor's strike, so the content of his set steered clear of his acting work. "I focus on pro-strike material," he joked on <a href=#>FOX5 Las Vegas</a>, before noting that his set actually&nbsp;highlights his childhood in Michigan. "I grew up in a rough part of Detroit, you may have heard of it — it's called Detroit," he quipped.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxiboV4hI5yZ6xlo6O5br%2FTmqmsZaSksaLFjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./uber-lyft-drivers-to-strike-in-major-cities-ahead-of-uber-wall-street-debut.html><span>←</span><span>Uber, Lyft Drivers to Strike in Major Cities Ahead of Uber Wall Street Debut</span></a>
