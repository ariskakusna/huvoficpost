He was also ordered not to contact the singer directly or indirectly, or post about him on social media.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Tarazaga-Orero was given a 12-month community order and 30 days of rehabilitation. Dean said: “You should be aware that failing to comply with a community order is a criminal offence that carries a maximum five-year prison sentence.”</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Katy Weiss, prosecuting, said: “I spoke to Mr Styles yesterday and he’s adamant he wants [the defendant] to get help, although he doesn’t want to see him again.”</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>The court heard Styles first came in contact with Tarazaga-Orero after noticing him sleeping rough close to his north <a href=# data-link-name="in body link" data-component=auto-linked-tag>London</a> home, and offered him money to get food or a hotel. Styles told the court: “I thought it was sad that someone so young was sleeping rough at a bus stop when it was cold.”</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Tarazaga-Orero, a vegan, asked for edamame beans, the court heard. The following day, the singer returned with two sandwiches, two salads and two muffins from a vegan cafe but decided to stop interacting with the defendant because of his “odd” behaviour.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Styles told the court: “He asked me if I wanted to go to a restaurant to eat. I told him I was on my way to work. I found it a little odd. His facial expression made me feel a little uneasy. It was like a smirk. Until that point, I never felt unsafe or uneasy in my own home.”</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Despite severing contact with the man on the advice of his security staff, Styles continued to see Tarazaga-Orero “incredibly often … almost every day”. In April, Tarazaga-Orero posted coins to the value of £49.95 through the singer’s letterbox.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Styles said he was also followed into a local pub a number of times and stopped on a run on 30 May by Tarazaga-Orero, who asked for money.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>The defendant claimed he chose to sleep in Styles’s neighbourhood after he became homeless in February because it felt safer than central London. He said he could make up to £100 from the public each day, adding: “I was surprised, and many people helped me.”</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>When asked whether he had stalked the celebrity, Tarazaga-Orero said: “That was never my intention. In the end, I just wanted the money he offered me.”</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>He denied being obsessed or in love with Styles.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>The defendant suggested the pop star propositioned him, telling the court he had said: “‘Let’s come to a hotel, let’s have some fun’, or something like that.”</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>The court heard Tarazaga-Orero’s stalking continued to have a “significant impact” on Styles’s day-to-day life.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>The singer said: “I never really encountered this kind of behaviour before. I’ve employed a night guard. I continue to lock my bedroom door at night.” He added that he continued to check for weak spots in his home.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Tarazaga-Orero carried a copy of the Gita, a Hindi holy book adopted by the Hare Krishna movement, and wore a necklace of paper flowers in the dock.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaKWlqLake5FpaHJnn5jBcH6QaJ%2BaqqKuerTA2KWcrGWjqa6tt8SrZKimlWKxqr7EnKuip55iwKq6xp6p</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./demetrius-big-meech-flenory-biography-net-worth-siblings-age-kids-release-date-wife-parents.html><span>←</span><span>Demetrius 'Big Meech' Flenory Biography: Net Worth, Siblings, Age, Kids, Release Date, Wife, Parents</span></a>
