"I think we're bringing some comfort to the family, though it does not bring Takeoff back.

"If they thought he was involved in the shooting, they would have charged him with it."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Police also confirmed Takeoff had no involvement in the argument, which stemmed from a dice game.
