Earlier this week, the Mississippi native took to social media to show off what the "Low" performer got him for Christmas, unveiling a custom pink and black "Jet Car."

Jet Car Official, come on baby. Give it to me, Jet Car Official. And if they want one of these, where can they get one from? Oh, you already know I’m gonna tag Jet Car Official.

It’s going down. Flo Rida, Freezy, much love. You already know.” The hitmaker's new jet car is far from his first luxury vehicle, however. Last month, he hopped on social media once again to unveil <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">his impressive car collection</a>. He has so many, in fact, that he has to use his private jet hangar to store them all.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What do you think of Flo Rida getting Rick Ross a custom pink and black "jet car" for Christmas this year? Do you think it was a <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">generous gift</a>?
