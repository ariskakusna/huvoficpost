When asked about her style during the interview, Monáe claimed she was looking to be a positive role model for young girls, claiming that she believed covering up was the way to do so. “People don’t ask <a href=# class=text-word rel>Jay-Z</a> to take his shirt off when he rhymes,” she explained, "Redefine what it means to be sexy and what it means to be a woman." "Showing my skin is not what makes me sexy," she claimed, "I like skirts and dresses just like everyone else, but I had a message I needed to put out there. It was up to me to show people and young girls there was another way.”</p><p>Users have dug up the interview, calling Monáe out for stripping down more than a few times as of late. Her "self-renaissance" has included posing topless for Rolling Stone, telling them, “I’m much happier when my titties are out and I can run around free.” Monáe also r<a href=# rel>ecently revealed the album art for The Age Of Pleasure</a>, which again, features the performer posing topless. She explained to Rolling Stone, that a personal evolution has allowed her to feel, "more nude, more present, and less anxious," than ever. The artist also recently <a href=# rel>flashed her chest during a performance</a> earlier this month, leading to a Twitter uproar.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Janelle Monáe Explains Her Recent Antics: “I’m Much Happier When My Titties Are Out”</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-monae-is-more-nude-than-ever>Monáe Is "More Nude" Than Ever</h2></span><p>Social media has been quick to scrutinize the performer amid her newfound confidence in revealing her body. “Sad to say, but money and fame do change some people,” one social media wrote in response to the resurfaced comments. Another added, “She literally ‘changed’ from trying to show girls a better way to being on some nut shit.” Someone else chimed in, saying, "It’s called she trying sell albums lol."</p><p>Some users, on the other hand, came to Monáe's defense, claiming, “It’s ok to evolve and change your mind." One user showed their support, adding, “She showed y’all that for over a decade. Now she’s on a different time.” Another commenter raised the question, “People can’t gain confidence or evolve?”</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Janelle Monáe Flashes Her Chest To Crowd On Stage, Social Media Gets Seriously Thirsty</a></strong></p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">[Via]</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmbX95fpNmoZqmlaG5pnnMqKWanV2Yrq24xJ1kobGgpLCztdOeZK2noKGytL%2BMnqma</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-get-hulu-on-nintendo-switch-html.html><span>←</span><span>How To Get Hulu On Nintendo Switch</span></a>
