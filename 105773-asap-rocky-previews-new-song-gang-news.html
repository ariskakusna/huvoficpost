We do know a few details, scant as they may be: the rapper <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">previously told GQ </a>a little bit about the album's sonic direction, stating "My new album is really about testing new sounds.

However, in this era of surprise releases, anything is possible. The question is, what will a new A$AP Rocky album sound like?&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdhZYJ4g5JmmKyZoGK%2FsK%2FKsmSpqpWrtqbD0malnq9dqLyvs4ygmKefXaOyuL8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./a-look-into-the-life-of-michael-bolton.html><span>←</span><span>A Look Into The Life Of Michael Bolton</span></a>
