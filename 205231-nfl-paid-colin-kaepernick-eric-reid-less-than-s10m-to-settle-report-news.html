To put things in perspective, Kaepernick's base salary in 2016 alone was nearly $12 million, according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">ESPN</a>.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Kaepernick, 31, opted out of his contract with the 49ers in March 2017, and has hardly received any interest from teams since.
