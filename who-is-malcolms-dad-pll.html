In the time jump, when Aria and Jason were in a romantic relationship, they broke up because Aria accepted a job offer hoping to cross paths with Ezra again.<h2>Is Caleb Rivers A ghost?</h2>He's the second ghost of the five from 1918 to be seen in the present day.<h2>Are Caleb and Miranda related PLL?</h2>Miranda and Caleb were married by a ship captain, but they died from a boating accident with three of their friends later that day.
