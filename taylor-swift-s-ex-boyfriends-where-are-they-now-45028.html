Not quite. <strong><a href=#>Taylor Swift</a></strong>‘s past relationships haven’t always lasted, but the songstress has found a longtime love with <strong><a href=#>Joe Alwyn</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Over the years, Taylor’s dating history has been a <a href=#>huge topic of conversation</a>. She’s been romantically linked to <a href=#><strong>Joe Jonas</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Harry Styles</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Taylor Lautner</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Jake Gyllenhaal</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>John Mayer</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Calvin Harris</strong></a>&nbsp;and <a href=#><strong>Tom Hiddleston</strong></a>, among others, in the past and used those experiences as the inspiration <a href=#>for some major hit songs</a>.</p><p>“You’re going to have people who are going to say, ‘Oh, you know, like, she just writes songs about her ex-boyfriends.’ And I think frankly that’s a very sexist angle to take. No one says that about <a href=#><strong>Ed Sheeran</strong></a>. No one says that about <a href=#><strong>Bruno Mars</strong></a>. They’re all writing songs about their exes, their current girlfriends, their love life, and no one raises the red flag there,” Taylor declared on <a href=#>Australian radio show in 2014</a>. “I have a really strict personal policy that I never name names. And so anybody saying that a song is about a specific person is purely speculating.”</p><p>And speculate the fans do! Each of Taylor’s albums is littered with meaningful lyrics that send fans in a frenzy trying to decode who they’re about. The only ones in which she’s appeared to, more or less, confirm are the more recent new songs about <a href=#>her longterm love with Joe</a>. In fact, the British actor has even assisted when it comes to writing music.</p><p>“It was weird because I had never made an album and not played it for my girlfriends or told my friends,” Taylor told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener><i class=ae-exclude>Entertainment&nbsp;Weekly</i></a> in November 2020 about her album Folklore. “The only people who knew were the people that I was making it with, my boyfriend, my family and then my management team.”</p><p></p><p>She also noted that it was a “surprise” when they “started writing together.”</p><p>Taylor told <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Zane Lowe</strong> on Apple Music</a>: “But in a way, it wasn’t because we have always bonded over music and had the same musical tastes.”</p><p>Because of the trust they have in each other, especially when it comes to music, the “Look What You Made Me Do” musician always confides in her man first.&nbsp;“Joe, who is the first person that I play every single song that I write, and I had the best time writing songs with you in quarantine,” Taylor gushed during her 2021 Grammy Awards speech.</p><p><strong>Scroll through our gallery for a look at Taylor’s complete dating history.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Love J-14?
