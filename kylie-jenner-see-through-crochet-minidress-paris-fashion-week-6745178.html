But it was her third and final look of the evening that had everyone talking.&nbsp;<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On her way to the Balmain spring-summer 2023 fashion show last night, Kylie wore a white crochet minidress that had a lot going on. Not only did the dress feature an extreme plunging neckline that scooped down to the middle of her ribcage, but also a see-through skirt, side cutouts, and a trio of dangling straps that hung beneath each shoulder.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kylie paired the nearly-naked dress with naked heels and a polished beauty look. Her dark hair was pulled back into a sleek bun with a middle part that highlighted her signature overly-lined lips and bronzed skin below.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jenner's latest PFW outing came right before a new episode of The Kardashians aired on Hulu. During the episode, Kylie detailed her second postpartum journey and how she didn't feel as much pressure to snap back this time around. "With your first baby it is a shock to see your body change so much. This time around I don't feel that way at all. Maybe mentally it is harder but seeing my body [reminds me] that I trust the process," Kylie <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>said</a> while speaking with her mom, Kris. "I am way less stressed about my weight and what I look like. I am more into the feminine energy and the fact that I made a baby."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57yrKjop1dn7KvusSrZKydlWLBqb7Orp6hZZOnvKS0xK1kpqGenrGzsdKsZKmZop7AbrLArJ%2Bip55ixKaxymZtcGxlZoR5</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kate-mara-net-worth-in-2023-how-rich-is-she-now-html.html><span>←</span><span>Kate Mara Net Worth in 2024 | How Rich is She Now?</span></a>
