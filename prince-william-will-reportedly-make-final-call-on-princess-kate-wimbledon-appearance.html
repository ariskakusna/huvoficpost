It hasn’t changed, either. I think that’s what’s so wonderful.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ir3wPMUn56z5vTfuvS3p5X-1920-80.jpg><p>Not totally sold on William being the ultimate decision maker about Kate’s attendance—she’s a grown woman and can make decisions like that herself—but if she goes or not, William won’t be there, unfortunately. Per <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/william-wont-be-at-wimbledon-to-support-kate-if-she-returns-to-the-public-eye referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>The Daily Beast</u></a>, William is spoken for, and for a sporting event, too—he’ll be in Germany this weekend cheering on England’s soccer team in the final of the European Football Championship, which will see England face off against Spain. William is patron of Britain’s Football Association, and if England wins, it’ll be the team’s first international tournament victory since it won the World Cup in 1966.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
