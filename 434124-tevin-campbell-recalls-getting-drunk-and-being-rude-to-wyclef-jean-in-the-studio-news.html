The "Can We Talk" icon has been in the industry for most of his life as he launched his singing career as a young teen looking for his big break.

I can tell you the story of when I had too much to drink and I was working with Wyclef," said the singer. "This is actually pretty funny... I had a session with Wyclef. Great session, we did some great songs. And so, before the session, I went into the lobby at the bar and had eight cosmopolitans. Eight. In the span of probably two hours, three hours. So, I was sh*t-faced."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Campbell said they went into the studio and listened to a few&nbsp;tracks, "and every song he played for me I was like, 'Oh, that sucks. That's horrible, play the next one."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I was cursing, too! I was being very, very nasty and just horrible," Campbell recalled. "I was like, 'This sh*t sucks. What the f*ck is this, play the next one... And so, then he called my mom 'cause he couldn't take it anymore. I was drunk!<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> Acting a fool, acting like a brat.</a>" Wyclef made sure to update Campbell's mother on the situation, but even with his mother on the line, the singer admitted that it didn't change a thing.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The session was canceled due to Campbell's antics and the singer believes that Wyclef "still holds that against me 'til this day... maybe not."
