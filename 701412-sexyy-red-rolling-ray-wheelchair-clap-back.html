The reality star also had some words for <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Sexyy Red</a>, blatantly letting the St. Louis native know that he wasn't feeling her recent performance look. She shared two selfies from the party, captioned, "Heard you want a stud. I got the STD, all I need is U üíã."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The wordplay earned her some laughs, but Ray was quick to come for Red's appearance with his quote tweet. "[You] look terrible friend, but [you] going keep that money on [you] so I ain't mad!" he tweeted early on Monday. "We all got our days. I still love [you] üòç." Some of the Catfish alum's fans are hyping him up for hating on the "Pound Town" hitmaker, but Red made it clear that she's unfazed by his attempts to bring her down.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10">Rolling Ray isn't Feeling the Hood Hottest Princess</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"You need ah new chair?" the 25-year-old asked her new nemesis this afternoon, along with a photo of even more money thrown across her lap. Rather than taking the dig to heart, Ray lashed out at Sexyy once again, accusing her of carrying around the same stack of cash since she first blew up. "[You] can tell [you] never had no real money before," he told her.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Following that, the disabled entertainer shared receipts of some of his own money, writing "Never broke I‚Äôll buy your whole family! And have your dude cleaning my a**. Let‚Äôs really wake it up!!!!" to further taunt the "SkeeYee" star.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-sexyy-red-responds-ray-continues-the-drama>Sexyy Red Responds, Ray Continues the Drama</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Keep scrolling to see what else Rolling Ray had to say in response to Sexyy Red's clap back to his diss.
