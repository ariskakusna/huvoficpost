I can only assume his sinister low ponytail has assumed control of his mind. Frankly, I've never felt more seen by an episode, so let's get right to it.</p><h2 data-node-id=1 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60">Roger Has One Job—and Fails.<br></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Last time we checked on Roger, who's hilariously taken to calling himself "Captain Roger McKenzie," he was put in charge of recruiting local men to join Jamie's militia. And bless his heart, he simply isn't up to the task. Basically, Roger and his crew get shot at by a man who's furious because a member of Jamie's militia (hi, Isaiah) had sex with his daughter Alicia, ruining her lucrative arranged marriage in the process. And while Jamie would have handled this situation perfectly, Roger straight-up turns Isaiah over like a total narc, gets everyone wasted on whiskey, and a bunch of people ditch his militia as a result. OH GOD, ROGER IS SINGING. No! My ears! My eyes! My soul!</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Fortunately, there's no image of this harrowing scene, but if you're searching for a visual, please turn your attention to this (sorry!).</p><img alt="Guitar, String instrument, Musician, Guitarist, String instrument, Musical instrument, Plucked string instruments, Facial hair, String instrument accessory, Music, " title="Guitar, String instrument, Musician, Guitarist, String instrument, Musical instrument, Plucked string instruments, Facial hair, String instrument accessory, Music, " width=480 height=480 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/giphy-7-1542549202.gif?resize=640:*" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Giphy</span></p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60">Jamie Saves the Day, Per Usual.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Jamie and Claire just happen to roll in right in the middle of Roger's song—the lyrics of which are "bonnie laddie, heathen laddie." I can only assume he's singing about Jamie and himself, respectively!</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Obviously, Jamie's pissed at Roger for ruining literally everything with his outstanding ineptitude, and to make matters more complicated, Isaiah reveals he's married. So not only did this guy have sex with a woman out of wedlock (a big no-no in these very misogynistic times), he also cheated on his wife in the process. Fortunately, Jamie fixes everything while Roger lurks in the background, secretly freeing Isaiah, convincing the men of the house to join his militia, and doing a celebratory jig.<br></p><img alt="Fun, Darkness, Event, Night, Performance, " title="Fun, Darkness, Event, Night, Performance, " width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ols5-504-060719-0357-a-1583689477.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Mark Mainz</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">STARZ</span></p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60">PLOT TWIST: Alicia Is Pregnant.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And she's a mess over Isaiah leaving. At first, Claire tries tough love, but then she and Jamie find Alicia attempting to take her own life in the woods and realize she's truly in love with Isaiah. And, surprise! He shows up to declare his devotion, and Claire and Jamie help them run away together—freeing a bunch of horses to distract Alicia's family. Oh, and if you're wondering, Roger is completely unhelpful throughout this entire scene.</p><img alt="Hair, Face, Human, Chin, Forehead, Surfer hair, Beard, Facial hair, Smile, Photography, " title="Hair, Face, Human, Chin, Forehead, Surfer hair, Beard, Facial hair, Smile, Photography, " width=600 height=600 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/giphy-1583689572.gif?resize=640:*" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">STARZ</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Also, in the event that you're curious about that cute baby Claire and Jamie took into their care last week, they place her with a woman who's recently lost her own child. In the process, Claire and Jamie have a real talk about whether they want to raise the baby themselves, but decide it will have a better time away from Fraser's Ridge. Considering Fraser's Ridge is currently full of hazardous moldy bread, I'm going to have to agree.</p><h6 class="css-x7mxm2 e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60">Claire Accidentally Becomes Famous.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Remember last week when Fergus mistakenly took one of Claire's medical notes to the printer? Turns out, he published her thoughts—er, Dr. Rawlings' thoughts—in a newspaper and now Claire's famous. Between this and penicillin, Claire's pretty much out here inventing modern medicine—and speaking of, one of the twins she and Jamie freed last week now has tonsillitis, so she has to go back to Fraser's Ridge to perform yet another emergency surgery. And get this: Jamie sends Roger back with her because he's doing such a terrible job as captain. Bless!</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60">A Quick Update on Brianna...</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She is understandably very stressed that Stephen Bonnet is lurking around Fraser's Ridge, and even thinks he's stolen her baby during a scary moment when she can't find him. Fortunately, Marsali helps Brianna feel a little bit better by sharing some of her own trauma, and Bri ends up burning the charcoal drawings she made of Bonnet. Still, something tells me this villain's story is far from over.</p><img alt="Darkness, Human, Fun, Photography, Night, Adaptation, Room, Flash photography, Midnight, Conversation, " title="Darkness, Human, Fun, Photography, Night, Adaptation, Room, Flash photography, Midnight, Conversation, " width=2000 height=1334 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ols5-504-051719-0114-a-1583689710.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Mark Mainz</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">STARZ</span></p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/281ca4da-3e06-4994-8c0d-6abe79956de7_1539814210.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Mehera Bonner" title="Headshot of Mehera Bonner" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Mehera Bonner is a celebrity and entertainment news writer who enjoys Bravo and Antiques Roadshow with equal enthusiasm, She was previously entertainment editor at Marie Claire and has covered pop culture for over a decade.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfmMKtwNSrnGiemaG6bsDVaJhsaWJsgHeDkGimrqyclrulsdFmqp6Zo6S7boGMnqeiq5%2BZsm6AjKucnJmgZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./orion-man-arrested-on-child-pornography-charges.html><span>←</span><span>Orion man arrested on child pornography charges</span></a>
