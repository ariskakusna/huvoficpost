The Gator, the institution’s mascot, was originally used in 1931, when the school was founded. A student newspaper, the Bay Leaf, put up a plea for a mascot, and students responded with the “alligator,” which they thought represented power and tenacity. In homage to the Golden Gate, the students also proposed the spelling “Golden Gaters,” which includes the letter “e.”

風邪をあまり悲惨な状態にしないためには亜鉛の力を信じ、すぐに摂れば具合が悪くならないと言う人がいる。亜鉛はミネラル界の"宝石"なのか、それとも単なる思い込みなのか？専門家に話を聞いてみた。
亜鉛は風邪の症状に効果的？何をもって"効果的"とするかによる。亜鉛には風邪を防いだり治すと言えるほど十分なデータはないが、回復を早めることはできるかもしれない。2013年に行われた、ある系統的レビューで、風邪の症状が現れてから24時間以内に亜鉛を摂取すれば、風邪の期間を12〜24時間短くするのに役立つかもしれないことがわかっている。
つまり、息苦しい感じがし始めたらすぐに亜鉛を摂取すれば、平均7日間と言われる風邪の期間が、もしかすると6日間になるかもしれないということだ。それに価値があるかどうかは、あなたの見方次第だ。
研究者の中には、亜鉛が役に立つかどうかは、通常、風邪の原因になる迷惑な病原体ライノウイルスにどう作用するかによると、内科医で『MCG Health』の医師編集者のクリスティーナ・ランドバーグは言う。
ライノウイルスは鼻腔や喉（上気道系）で増殖する傾向にあるが、「亜鉛が人間のライノウイルスが鼻腔の粘膜につくのを防ぐ役に立つというエビデンスがあり、それによってウイルスの複製を遅らせ、風邪の症状緩和につながることが期待できるのです。とはいえ、亜鉛がウイルス性の病気に役立つメガニズムはあまりよく理解されていませんけどね」とランドバーグ。
亜鉛を摂取するベストな方法は？亜鉛を摂取する方法はいろいろある。まず、シロップやドロップ（トローチ）で摂ることができ、免疫力を高める成分（抗酸化物質が豊富なエルダーベリーなど）や、苦味のある成分を飲みやすくするための香料などがミックスされていることが多い。
また、亜鉛をそのまま錠剤やカプセルで摂るという方法もある。
どちらがより効果的なのだろう？ランドバーグ医師によると、亜鉛のサプリかドロップか、あるいは他の形かを比較する研究はなされていないので判定はできない。
だが、ドロップが「現在出ている中ではベストな処方。ドロップやシロップは鼻腔や咽頭に留まり、体内に吸収されていくのでベストではないかと考える人がいます」とランドバーグ。
亜鉛を摂取するタイミングについては、風邪かな？と思ったら、すぐに摂ること。「風邪の症状に何らかのメリットを得るには、風邪の症状が出たら24時間以内に取り始めましょう」とランドバーグ。
「風邪にかかったら、毎日、10日間ほど摂ります。処方によって異なるので、パッケージで推奨されている説明に従いましょう」
風邪のときに亜鉛を摂ってもリスクはないの？メイヨー・クリニックによると、亜鉛を経口摂取するのは一般的には安全だが、ドロップは後味の悪さが残るという人や、吐き気を催すという人もいるという。だが、専門家のほとんどは、スプレーで鼻から亜鉛を摂ることには反対している。人によっては、永久に嗅覚を失う原因になるからだ。
また、亜鉛は特定の薬剤を妨げることも知られている。例えば、抗生物質を服用している場合、亜鉛は体が適切にそれを吸収するのを妨げるため、細菌と戦う力を弱めてしまう可能性がある。
あるいは、関節リウマチの治療でぺニシラミンを服用している場合、亜鉛は関節の痛みを和らげる薬の力を低減してしまうかもしれない。
そのため、薬を服用している場合は、亜鉛サプリを摂る前に医師に相談するのがベストだ。
結論：亜鉛で風邪を治すことはできないが、回復を早める助けになる可能性はある総合的に見て、クリーブランド・クリニックの専門家は、風邪から早く回復するベストで最も安全な方法は、たっぷり休養をとることだと言う。
水分をたっぷりと摂って鼻や喉の潤いを保ちながら、乾燥させるアルコールやカフェインを避けると、消化を助け炎症を鎮める役に立つ一方、鼻や喉の粘膜からできるだけ早くウイルスを除去することができる。
だから、できれば仕事を休み、ハーブティーで温まり、よく眠ること。1週間程度で元気になるはずだ。だが、症状が10日経っても治まらない場合は、病院で特別な治療が必要な病気（気管支炎や肺炎、副鼻腔感染症など）にかかっていないかどうか診察してもらおう。

A toilet that whines after you flush it or at odd intervals throughout the night is typically caused by a malfunctioning fill valve that has to be replaced. As a fill valve ages, the interior components may degrade, resulting in the whistling and hissing noises that most people experience when they have this condition.
Additionally, individuals inquire as to why their toilet makes a high-pitched noise. Whatever the sound is, whether it’s a little whistle or an ear-piercing scream, the high-pitched sound you hear when your toilet refills indicates that either the fill valve gasket needs to be replaced or that you need a new valve.</description></item><item><title>Why Enrique Iglesias Will No Longer Release Any More Albums</title><link>/why-enrique-iglesias-will-no-longer-release-any-more-albums.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/why-enrique-iglesias-will-no-longer-release-any-more-albums.html</guid><description>The title of Enrique Iglesias' new album, "Final," is to be taken quite literally, as the "Be With You" hitmaker has no aspiration to make any more albums.

It is not recommended to use milk jugs, anti-freeze jugs, glass containers, or numerous ‘gas cans’ for the transportation or storage of gasoline. When exposed to gasoline, certain polymers become brittle and incompatible with the fuel. Another problem is that some containers are not sturdy enough to endure the pressures of expansion and contraction produced by temperature fluctuations.
In light of this, is it possible to store gasoline in a plastic container?</description></item><item><title>Carlie Jo Howells biography: age, birthday, net worth, state</title><link>/1540604-carlie-jo-howells-biography-age-birthday-net-worth-state.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/1540604-carlie-jo-howells-biography-age-birthday-net-worth-state.html</guid><description>Carlie Jo Howell is an American social media model.

It is really cascabella peppers that are used in the IN-IN-OUT burgers that are yellow in colour. In addition to being cone shaped, Cascabella peppers grow to be roughly 1 34 inch long by 34 inch broad when mature. When fully developed, cascabellas change colour from yellow to orange to red.
What I’d want to know is whether or not In n Out has banana peppers? As Amy pointed out, there is no evidence that the “shortage” is hurting the chopped chilies that may be used to season fries or hamburgers at this time, but when you purchase a side order of entire yellow banana peppers, the pepper restriction becomes apparent.</description></item><item><title>What Happened To Mary On Las Vegas Tv Show</title><link>/what-happened-to-mary-on-las-vegas-tv-html.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/what-happened-to-mary-on-las-vegas-tv-html.html</guid><description>People are currently reading this guide.

Mulching heads, brush cutters, heavy-duty mowers, and other hydraulically powered attachments are all highly effective.

Toxicity to animals
For example, Carmex, Tiger Balm, Vicks VapoRub, Campho-Phenique, and other commonly used trade names that include camphor are listed below. Because camphor is easily absorbed through the skin, it should never be applied to dogs or cats due to the risk of poisoning they may experience.

Menthol is not harmful when breathed, but it may be dangerous if consumed in large quantities, so keep the Biofreeze bottle away from Shanie and any other children.</description></item><item><title>Italian towns claim Ron DeSantis as one of their own as Republican race heats up | Ron DeSantis</title><link>/italian-towns-claim-ron-desantis-as-one-of-their-own-as-republican-race-heats-up.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/italian-towns-claim-ron-desantis-as-one-of-their-own-as-republican-race-heats-up.html</guid><description>The ObserverRon DeSantis This article is more than 7 months oldItalian towns claim Ron DeSantis as one of their own as Republican race heats upThis article is more than 7 months oldAll eight great-grandparents of the White House hopeful, eager to restrict immigrants’ rights, came from the south of Italy

Refrigerate the crème brûlées one more before serving them warm. It is customary for crème brûlées to be served at room temperature. Alternatively, if you like it cold, return the ramekins to the refrigerator. For best results, keep them refrigerated for 30 to 45 minutes before serving (no longer, otherwise the sugar crust may begin to soften).
As a result, can Creme Brulee be stored in the refrigerator overnight?</description></item><item><title>Does leaving the Gulag count as a death?</title><link>/does-leaving-the-gulag-count-as-a-death.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/does-leaving-the-gulag-count-as-a-death.html</guid><description>If you you lose your gulag.
