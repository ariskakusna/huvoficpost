Instead of egging on their <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">toxicity</a>, the "Thotiana" rapper has mostly been focused on the family he <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">shares with Jaidyn Alexis</a>. At the same time, Rock has been attempting to raise her son on her own while still working on her music career. Most of her past releases have been joint efforts with her co-parent, but now, it looks like the new mother has found a different man to help write her lyrics.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Earlier this week, Chrisean teamed up with Lil Mabu for <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"MR. TAKE YA B**CH,"</a> on which the rising star raps about taking Blue's woman away from him. "I like blue faces, so I took his baby," the latter spits throughout the track. Now that it's been out for a few days, plenty of reactions have been pouring in online, many of them suggesting that Rock is the problem. These only increased after a live stream during which the 23-year-old confirmed that Mabu was responsible for penning the track.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-chrisean-rock-and-lil-mabu-discuss-mr-take-ya-b-ch>Chrisean Rock and Lil Mabu Discuss "MR.

"I'm proud of Blueface, he haven't paid her no mind lately," another chimed in. "Anything to get her [baby daddy's] attention," someone else suggested.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I'm just glad he's not paying her no mind. This all she know, because y'all hype her up," they continued. "This girl been on IG every d**n day, like mama, take time for yourself. Go away for a good month. Take care of your child. Let the [people] wonder about [you].
