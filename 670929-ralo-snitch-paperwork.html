Ever since <a href=# rel>his arrest</a>, he earned praise from his peers in the streets and in the industry for keeping it solid. However, he now found himself tangled up in rumors of cooperating with authorities. Alleged paperwork surfaced, which read, “the specific information that Mr. Davis supposedly gave in the June 6th proffer against other persons, other alleged transactions, other alleged crimes.” Unfortunately, this piece of information alone led social media to question whether Ralo actually snitched on other people to get out of prison.</p><p>Ultimately, Ralo put these rumors to rest in an Instagram post. He began to say that he hates to see “us as people continue to kick one another down.” From there, he said that the government has a history of pinning people against each other before explicitly stating that he never snitched. “I never told yawl one lie in my life and I swear by Allah I never cooperated with the federal government,” he said. “It’s not one human being on Earth can say they in jail for RALO,” he added before stating that he’s “ready to post all the proof.” The rapper later shared the full documentation on his Instagram page.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ralo-s-paperwork>Ralo's Paperwork</h2></span><p>Shortly after he posted this message, a phone call leaked between Ralo and one of the Famgoon artists. The artist said that the paperwork claimed Ralo provided a proffer two months after his arrest and shared information on his phone with the prosecutors. “I ain’t opposed to that. The document that you seeing is from a prosecutor misconduct hearing,” he said. At this point, his artist listed the paperwork claiming that he provided other information. Still, Ralo said that he never cooperated and the only reason this is public information is because of the hearing.&nbsp;</p><p>A judge sentenced Ralo to 8 years in prison for his alleged involvement in a drug trafficking case where authorities found pounds of cannabis on his private jet. The rapper revealed that he’ll be released from prison and into a halfway house on <a href=# rel>September 4th, 2023</a>. In the meantime, he continued to release new music such as his latest project, <a href=# rel>97 Months</a>, which arrived in April and included appearances from <a href=# class=text-word rel>Jadakiss</a>, Rowdy Rebel, and more.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Call</h2></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmbH16fphmqZqkn2LAr7XTnJ9mqJGlsrPDzqui</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./princess-anne-blue-floral-dress-first-garden-party-summer.html><span>←</span><span>Princess Anne makes a surprising statement in colour she rarely wears</span></a>
