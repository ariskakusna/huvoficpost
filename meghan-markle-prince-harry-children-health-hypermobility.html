Not enough collagen in the body&nbsp;can make joints loose and stretchy."</p><p id=eITlkOPRzK7u data-wc=1><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>9 simple ways Meghan Markle stays fit and healthy</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/24321511e889-meghan-markle-pregnant-z.jpg><p id=ee-KksewTN-N data-wc=8><strong>Meghan Markle appears to have a hypermobile thumb</strong></p><p id=eKf08-omkrbr data-wc=91>As for the likelihood of Meghan passing the condition onto Lillibet and Archie, it’s not a dead cert, but it comes down to the genetic mutation of collagen – the stuff that protects our joints and acts as a cushioning for them to move smoothly without pain. If Lillibet and Archie do end up with the same kind of condition, it’s not a major concern, rather it just means they’ll have a bigger range of movement in their joints, so strengthening the surrounding muscles to keep everything stable is a must.&nbsp;</p><p id=e55HzKtP6LBo data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>7 royals who practise yoga to inspire you</a></strong></p><p id=ew--ni7SmDI2 data-wc=27>Anisha adds: "Many people with hypermobility don’t experience pain, and strength training is great to keep symptoms at bay - such as joints popping out or dislocating."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9b9bd6f06418-meghan-markle-yoga-z.jpg><p id=emFI-K1tXoA9 data-wc=4><strong>Meghan Markle practices&nbsp;yoga</strong></p><p id=eNL1yNljoxld data-wc=62>Meghan hasn’t confirmed whether or not she actually has hypermobile joints elsewhere in her body, but it would also explain why she’s pretty good at yoga. Past photos from her former&nbsp;lifestyle blog The Tig showed that she could master some of the more advanced yoga moves that require a lot of flexibility in the joints, so it would certainly make sense.</p><p id=eRQvP5BtWWcd data-wc=23><strong>Make sure you never miss a ROYAL story! <a class=hm-link href=#>Sign up to our newsletter</a> to get all of our celebrity, royal and lifestyle news delivered directly to your inbox.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaJ%2BemZyptW6tzZ1kn6Gko7K0v45rZ2tpYG5%2BdX2Ram1ubV%2Bisqi0wKdkppmioLmmec%2BroKeblWK1or7RsmScoJmhsbOxzWafnpmcqbVutNipnKuln5e2rbXTsmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1596127-man-shares-impressive-story-supportive-girlfriend-marries-passing-nysc.html><span>←</span><span>Man Shares Impressive Story of His Supportive Girlfriend, Marries Her After Passing Out From NYSC</span></a>
