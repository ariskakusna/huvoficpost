Unfortunately, when the song started getting popular, the people behind the songs that he referenced came looking for credit. Nappy Boy Gaming shared a clip of the conversation on Instagram, joking about <a href=# rel>the surprising revelation</a>. "'We' got money in the bank I guess [laughing emoji]," the post is captioned.

"So all those thing that I said in 'Buy U a Drank' that was from other songs, when 'Buy U a Drank' like blew up blew up, all them people and writers from them other songs they were owed sh*t from my song." He continued, revealing that he was shocked by the realization. "<a href=# rel>I was like 'what the f*ck,'</a>" he explained, "I was like paying homage and sh*t."</p><p>"'I got money in the bank,' Scrappy and his writers came for that," he continued. "Or ‘Snap ya fingers/ Do ya step,’ <a href=# class=text-word rel>Lil Jon</a> and <a href=# class=text-word rel>E-40</a> and everybody on that song came for me. <a href=# rel>They said this is ‘Our money in the bank.’</a>” Are you surprised that "publishing-wise," T-Pain made nearly nothing?
