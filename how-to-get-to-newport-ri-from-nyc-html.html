Land of sprawling mansions, fancy yachts, and chowder that could knock a pirate off his keel. But how, you ask, do you, a weary New Yorker (probably with a killer bodega coffee habit), embark on this nautical (or should we say nautical-ish) adventure? Fear not, intrepid traveler, for this guide will be your compass (or GPS, whichever you prefer)!</p><p data-sourcepos=5:1-5:66><strong>Setting Sail by Car: Hitting the Open Road (or I-95, Whatever)</strong></p><ul data-sourcepos=7:1-10:0><li data-sourcepos=7:1-8:0><p data-sourcepos=7:3-7:386><strong>The Speedy Route (for those with nerves of steel and a bladder of iron):</strong> Buckle up, buttercup! This route clocks in at around 3.5 hours, but be warned, it's all highway driving. Think of it as a real-life Mario Kart race, minus the banana peels (hopefully). Just remember, with great speed comes great responsibility (and the responsibility to use the left lane for passing only).</p></li><li data-sourcepos=9:1-10:0><p data-sourcepos=9:3-9:464><strong>The Scenic Route (for those who enjoy a bit of a detour and a lobster roll pitstop):</strong> Trade speed for charm on this coastal cruise. Take the Merritt Parkway for a leisurely drive, stopping off at charming towns like Mystic, Connecticut for a taste of New England goodness (and maybe a bit of whale watching). Just be prepared for some extra travel time and potentially getting stuck behind leaf peepers in the fall (those autumnal views are worth it, though).</p></li></ul><p data-sourcepos=11:1-11:33><strong>Land Ho! Arriving in Newport:</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=13:1-13:334>Congratulations, you've made it! Now, to navigate the final frontier: Newport itself. Here's a heads up: parking can be a beast, especially in the summer months. <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Download a parking app or snag a spot in a municipal lot on the outskirts and walk (those calories from the lobster roll won't burn themselves off, you know).</p><p data-sourcepos=15:1-15:68><strong>Alternative Routes: For Those Who Don't Dig Driving (or Traffic)</strong></p><ul data-sourcepos=17:1-20:0><li data-sourcepos=17:1-18:0><p data-sourcepos=17:3-17:302><strong>The Train</strong> Amtrak offers service to nearby Kingston station, where you can then snag a cab or rideshare to Newport. This is a great option if you want to kick back, relax, and avoid the stress of driving. Just remember to pack a good book (or prepare to be entertained by your fellow passengers).</p></li><li data-sourcepos=19:1-20:0><p data-sourcepos=19:3-19:284><strong>The Bus</strong> Several bus companies offer routes from NYC to Newport. It's a budget-friendly option, but be prepared for a longer journey. Think of it as a chance to unwind, catch up on some sleep, or write the next great American novel (hey, stranger things have happened on buses).</p></li></ul><p data-sourcepos=21:1-21:392><strong>So, there you have it, mateys!</strong> With a little planning and this trusty guide, you'll be sipping on a Dark and Stormy on a Newport patio in no time. Just remember, the most important thing is to relax, enjoy the journey, and maybe pack some seasickness medication (just in case... those harbor tours can get a little choppy). Now get out there and explore, you magnificent landlubber, you!</p>8762146905067766807<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWrGWtnZOdfHN8kW1maWxfnby4edOoZKCdpGLBsHnNnq6pp6KperO1jJ%2BpqKVdo8akesetpKU%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-is-the-elf-on-the-shelf-worth-html.html><span>←</span><span>How much is the elf on the shelf worth ?</span></a>
