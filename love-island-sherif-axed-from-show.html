I regret that I didn't conduct myself in the right way and, as a 20 year old guy, it's something I know I will take on board and learn from. I really enjoyed my time in the villa and look forward to catching up with everyone on the outside."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8b3f61ec206f-anna-and-sherif-kiss-on-love-island-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eppHUxI09xMH data-wc=5><strong>He was coupled with Anna</strong></p><p id=e96JFhjrsBp5 data-wc=1><strong>READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>Find out how Love Island contestants spend their Saturday day off in the villa</a></strong></p><p id=ecMi2YvxkSHL data-wc=173>This isn't the first time a contestant has quit the show, as in the 2018 series Niall Aslam left the series after he didn't disclose that he had Asperger's Syndrome to the show's producers. Explaining his reasons behind leaving on Facebook, he previously wrote: "For far too long I have suffered in silence and not acknowledged a massive fact about my life which going into the villa has led me to finally realise and accept. When I was a young child I was diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome, a fact that until this post has never shared outside of my close family… I always felt that people didn't understand me, yet I was afraid to reveal my true scales as I did not want the label or stigma that was attached to it. But now I think it is important that I come forward, not only so that I can finally be honest with myself and to those around me, but also so that other individuals in my position can embrace their true colours."</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">Love Island Contestants 2019 | Hello</a><p id=eFgLny7egtb5 data-wc=1><strong>READ:<a class=hm-link href=#> Find out everything you need to know about Love Island's Molly-Mae Hague</a></strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
