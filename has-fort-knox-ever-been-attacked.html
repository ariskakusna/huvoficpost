That would be over half a million 27-pound gold bars weighing a combined total of almost 7,000 tons.<h2>How much is a gold bar worth?</h2>A 100-gram gold bar will spot a price around $6,481. When you get to 10-ounces gold bars the spot price can vary from about $13,245 to $20,301 depending on the above factors. Finally, a kilo gold bar can be worth $64,353.<h2>How much is a gold bar worth in Fort Knox?</h2>Each bar weighs 400 troy ounces according to the U. S. Department of Treasury.
